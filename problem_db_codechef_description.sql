Each deck contains N cards. The cards in the first deck are numbered 1 through N from top to bottom, while the cards in the second deck are numbered N through 1 from top to bottom. Initially, all the cards are oriented face down.\n\nFor the magic trick, ChefX chooses two parametres S and M. The magic trick is performed in S steps.\n\nIn each step, ChefX asks ChefY to distribute M moves arbitrarily between these two decks. In one move, the topmost card from one deck is moved to the bottom of that deck. Then, ChefX performs the moves in the order chosen by ChefY. For example, if M = 10, ChefY could choose the moves in this order:\n1. Perform 2 moves on the first deck.\n2. Perform 3 moves on the second deck.\n3. Perform 5 moves on the first deck. \n\nAt the end of each step, ChefX takes the topmost cards from both decks (one card from each deck) and puts them aside, face down, next to each other. Each deck now contains one card less and the next step is performed with these reduced decks.\n\nAt the end, there are S pairs of cards that were put aside and ChefX reveals them to ChefY. The magic trick is successful when the cards in each pair have the same numbers.\n\nChefX has already chosen the parameter S. He knows that there are many possible values of M such that the magic trick is always successful regardless of how ChefY distributes the moves in each step, but there are also values of M such that it may be unsuccessful. Therefore, he would like to know the minimum possible M such that the magic trick with these parametres M and S is always successful. Can you help ChefX? Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\n'),(20503,'RIVERLND','\n\nThere is a country with a large river system. The cities in this country are numbered 1 through N; city number 1 is the capital. The river system forms a rooted tree such that the capital is the root. Each river connects two cities and flows towards the root. For each non-root city i, there is a river that flows from this city to city p_i. There is also a port in each city.\n\nIn the country, there are only two ways to travel between cities: by boat and by ferry. A boat can only move downstream (that is, towards the capital), while a ferry can move in both directions. There are direct ferry routes from every port to every other port.\n\nInitially, all the ports are open. Sometimes, some ports can close or open again (possibly multiple times); the port in the capital is always open. It is not allowed to travel by ferry from a closed port, but travelling to a closed port is allowed. Travelling by boat is always possible, even from a closed port.\n\nSometimes, Chef wants to go on a trip. He has already chosen a city v where he will start the trip. However, he only has enough money for at most one trip by ferry. Therefore, he wants to make a trip as follows:\n- Choose a city b with an opened port and travel to this city by boat. It must be possible to travel from v to b by boat (specifically, v=b is allowed).\n- Decide to either continue from city b by ferry or end the trip in this city.\n- If he decides to continue by ferry, choose a city f and travel from b to f by ferry. It must also be possible to travel from b to f by ferry.\n- It is not allowed to travel along any river twice (regardless of direction), i.e. when Chef decides to continue by ferry, the shortest paths between (v, b) and (b, f) must have no common rivers.\n\nChef likes travelling by ferry, so the more rivers he visits (travels along) on a ferry, the happier he becomes. Also, each city has a fixed beauty; let\'s denote the beauty of city i by a_i. Then, for a trip with value T, let\'s define the happiness Chef gains as a_b + D \\cdot T, where D is the length of the ferry route (the number of rivers visited when travelling by ferry — possibly zero).\n\nYou should process Q queries. There are three types of queries:\n- `- v`: The port in city v closes. It is guaranteed that the port in city v was open before this query.\n- `+ v`: The port in city v reopens. It is guaranteed that the port in city v was closed before this query.\n- `? v T`: Chef wants to make a trip with value T from city v.\n\nFor each query of the third type, find the maximum happiness Chef can gain from such a trip.\n\n'),(20518,'CATS','\n\nYou are given a rooted tree with N nodes labelled 1 through N.

The cats are frightened, so they want to climb the tree one by one, in the order C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_N. At any time, each node may contain at most one cat. When cat c wants to start climbing the tree, the following happens:\n- If there is already a cat in node c, then cat c leaves and decides to climb another tree. Otherwise, the cat makes a leap to node c.\n- Then, while there is no cat in the parent of this cat\'s current node, the cat jumps to the parent of its current node. When it is impossible to jump any further (due to reaching the root or finding a cat in the parent node), the cat stays in its current node.\n\nFind the number of jumps performed by each cat (including the initial leap to the tree).\n\n'),(19634,'MAXPRODU',''),(19639,'QUEUE2',''),(21936,'POLICE','\n\nThere are N police officers numbered 1 through N and M thieves numbered 1 through M.

For each i, the price of fuel in state i is fixed at F_i units of money per litre.\n\nDespite Professor\'s outstanding talent and his great scientific prowess, he has some bad habits as well: he is too penny-wise, so he carries huge barrels in his car in order to store extra petrol and avoid buying petrol in expensive states. Therefore, he is able to carry any amount of fuel he wants at any moment during the trip, and he is also fine with visiting the same state more than once on the trip if it saves him money.

The tree is rooted at node 1. The tree represents the structure of a big mafia syndicate, and\neach node represents a criminal. Each criminal, except the leader (who is denoted by node 1), is\nunder the supervision of his boss, who is his parent in the tree.\n\nInitially, each criminal/node except the leader has some money. Starting now, at every second, each criminal will pass on all the money that he has, to his boss (i.e. parent). And during the same second, his \'children\' might have passed on some amount to him, which he will pass on to his parent in the next second, and so on.\n\nHowever, a criminal might go rogue if the money he has strictly exceeds some threshold (that is, if the money that he has is greater than a particular value, he is overpowered by greed). Going rogue means, at some point, if the amount of money that he has to pass on to his boss is greater than the threshold, he won\'t do so, and instead keep the amount to himself. And after this, all the money that comes to him, he will keep to himself. He will not pass on anything after this.\n\nSo, as an example if there is a tree, 1 - 2 - 3, in which 1 is the root, 2 is beneath 1, and 3 is beneath 2. And suppose the amount of money that each of the criminals initially have is (Note that the root node will not have anything in the beginning):\n\nhave[1] = 0\n\nhave[2] = 10\n\nhave[3] = 100\n\nAnd their thresholds are:\n\ncap[2] = 10\n\ncap[3] = 1000\n\nThat is, if at any second, node 2 has strictly more than 10 amount of money, then he will turn rogue, and will stop passing the money to his boss.\n\n\nNow, at the first second, no criminal has more money than his threshold. So, both criminals 2 and 3 pass on their money to their bosses. Thus, after the first second, the criminals will have the following:\n\n\nhave[1] = 10\n\nhave[2] = 100\n\nhave[3] = 0\n\nBut now, since have[2] \\gt cap[2], criminal 2 turns rogue, and won\'t pass on any money to his boss anymore. Nothing changes after this, and so this is the stable state.\n\nYou can show that after some finite amount of time, the configuration remains constant, with no more passing of money. We call this the stable state. The problem is, given the tree with N nodes, and two arrays have[2], have[3], \\ldots, have[N] and cap[2], cap[3], \\ldots, cap[N] of size N - 1, find out the total money which the leader (ie. root node) will have at the end, in the stable state.\n\n'),(19897,'POLITRI','You are given an integer k.

Formally, each boolean function is a mapping from {0, 1}K to {0, 1}, where K is a number of variables of the function. Different functions in this problem can have different parameters of K. \n\nWe describe a boolean function F(x1, x2, ..., xK) by a string of 2K characters. Let\'s enumerate these characters from 0 to 2K-1. Let\'s take the i-th character of this string. This character will correspond to the value of the boolean function F on the set of parameters, corresponding to the last K bits of i in binary representation. For better understanding, let us have boolean function of K = 3 variables, described by a string S = 10101010. The value of F(0, 0, 0) is one, because in binary representation \"000\" is zero, and S[0] = 1. The value of F(0, 1, 1) is zero, because \"011\" in binary representation is three, and S[3] = 0.\n\nConsider a set of boolean functions {F1, F2, ..., FM}. We can combine the functions of this set, thus, obtaining the new functions. One function can be used as much times as possible in a single combination. For example, if we have set of two functions: {F1(x1, x2), F2(y1, y2, y3)}, we can obtain the following functions:\n\nG1(z1, z2, z3, z4) = F1(F2(z1, z2, z3), F2( z2, z3, z4))\n\nG2(z1, z2, z3, z4, z5) = F1(F2(z1, z2, z3), F2( z2, z3, z4))\n\nG3(z1, z2, z3, z4) = F1(F2(z1, z2, z3), F1( z2, z4))\n\nG4(z1) = F1(F2(z1, z1, z1), F1( z1, z1))\n\nG5(z1, z2, z3, z4) = F1(F1( F1(z1, z2), F1(z1, z2)), F1( F1(z3, z4), F1(z3, z4)))\n\nThese are just examples.

But have you ever wondered what you could do if you got a real Turing Machine -- one of those big metal things with all the cranks and levers and rolls of infinite tape that looks suspiciously like toilet paper?...\n\nThe sad answer is: there are few interesting things that can be done with such a machine. Even problems that have a little charm in the theoretical model (like the intractable Halting Problem) can be solved very efficiently with practical brute-force algorithms (see e.g. the figure at the end of the problem description). But there is one thing that you can do with a practical Turing Machine, and can\'t do with a theoretical one, and it is: to use it as a music box.Our Turing Machine has exactly one state variable (an integer in the range 0 to 999) and is equipped with an infinite tape, consisting of cells with symbols from a given alphabet encoded on them. A movable read/write head is positioned over some cell of the tape, and is operated according to the list of rules encoded in the machine. The rules are of the form S1 C1 S2 C2 M, which means: if the machine is in state S1 and C1 is written in the current cell, change state to S2, write C2 in the current cell, and move the head as described by move M (one cell left, one cell right, or not at all). If no matching rule is found for the given state the machine should halt.\nNow, here is the good bit. The head makes a creaking sound when performing each rule. It goes da when moved right, di when moved left, and um when left in place. Suppose that each cell of the tape can contain one of 16 possible symbols, formed as the concatenation of exactly two of the words: da, di, um and sh for silence. Initially, nearly all the cells of the tape are filled with the symbol shsh. Only a few (not more than 500) consecutive cells form a piece of music, each cell encoding a pair of sounds (one of 9 combinations of da, di or um, without any silences). The head of the machine is initially positioned over the leftmost of the cells containing sounds.\nNow it is your task to use the Turing machine to play the piece of music written on its tape (as read from left to right, starting from the initial position of the head, as far as the first silence) as accurately as possible, using the head itself to produce the sounds required.\n\nOutput\nThe output of your program must contain a set of rules describing the behaviour of the Turing Machine designed for playing music. Each rule must be of the form S1 C1 S2 C2 M, where S1 and S2 are integers from the range 0..999, C1 and C2 belong to the 16 symbols of the alphabet, while M describes the move direction of the head by the sound it makes (da, di or um).\n\nScore\n\nYour program will be tested multiple times for different pieces of music written on the tape. The score of your program is equal to the total of non-negative scores, taken over all test cases.\n\nFor a test case with n notes (n/2 non-silent cells) your program will receive n-d points, where d denotes the edit distance between the music played and the music required (i.e. the minimum total number of notes that have to be inserted into or changed in both the pieces to obtain the same piece of music).\n\nExample\n\nConsider the following set of rules output by a program:\n\n000 dada 000 dada da\n000 umda 000 dada da\n000 shsh 000 shsh da\n000 didi 001 didi di\n001 dada 002 didi di\n\n\nThen the results of exemplary testing could be as follows:\n\nMusic: da da|da da|da da|di di|um um\nPlays: da da da di di\nScore: 5\n\nMusic: um da|um da|um da|da um|di di\nPlays: da da da\nScore: 3\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 = 8 points\n\n\nBonus info: There are no more than 100 tests.

But he was surprised when Peter Xor\'s accepted solution outputted 15! Chef was confused because he can\'t see any path with a total cost of 15.\n\nAfter rereading the problem, Chef found his mistake. The problem\'s title was actually Xortest path, not Shortest path, so the problem was actually asking for the path between two given nodes with the least possible XOR! So in the example above, the answer is indeed 15, because the path 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 has an XOR cost of 36 ⊕ 50 ⊕ 11 ⊕ 18 = 15, and no other path has a lower XOR cost than this. In other words, this is the “xortest path”.\n\nNow that Chef knows his mistake, he still has a problem; he doesn\'t know how to answer this problem! Your task as his sous-chef is to answer this problem for him. Specifically, you have to answer Q queries, where each query is a pair of nodes, and the answer is the weight of the “xortest path” between them.\n\nNote that in this problem, a path may pass through an edge or node any number of times. (Some authors would call such a path a walk.) For instance, in the example above, the path 1 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 4 → 5 is also a “xortest path”, because its XOR cost is 36 ⊕ 16 ⊕ 11 ⊕ 50 ⊕ 16 ⊕ 18 = 15.\n\n'),(315,'BFORG','The relationship between The University of Byteland and King Johnny was never a friendly one.

Weird, she thought.\n\nCurious, Jalebi Bai asked a co-passenger the results of all the 100 multiplications between all pairs of digits.\n\nShe figured out that the Standard algorithm for multiplication on this planet follows the same rules as on Earth except that digit multiplication should follow the rule of that planet.\n\nShe also found out that any digit multiplied with 0 is 0, the multiplication of x with y is the same as the multiplication of y with x.\n\nAddition is defined to be same as that on the Earth.\n\nFor example, if the result of 2 multiplied with 4 is 9, 5 multiplied with 3 is 19, 2 multiplied with 3 is 17 and 4 multiplied with 5 is 24, then multiplication of 25 with 43 will give:\n\n\n\n			  25\n			  43\n		---------------\n			  19\n			 170\n			 240\n			 900\n		---------------\n			1329\n		---------------\n\nThe final answer will be 1329 (following the addition algorithm of the earth for managing carry).\n\nFinally Jalebi Bai meets the head chef of the planet, but the problem is he is ready to give her the recipe only if she can solve a puzzle. He asks her to find the sum of the results of multiplication (according to the planet) between all possible ordered pairs of numbers from the set of positive integer less than or equal to a given number A. Note: If i and j are distinct, then the pair (i,j) is considered different from (j,i).\n\nJalebi Bai then asks him for a formal multiplication algorithm of the planet, to which the head chef agrees and gives following description.\nThe multiplication of two numbers X and Y represented as arrays, with M as the digit multiplication matrix, is defined as follows:\n\nMultiply(X[1..p], Y[1..q])\n{\n    m = [1..p+q]  //Allocate space for result\n    for b = 1 to q\n    {\n        carry = 0\n        for a = 1 to p\n        {\n            m[a + b - 1] += carry + M[X[a]] [Y[b]]\n            carry = m[a + b - 1] /10\n            m[a + b - 1] = m[a + b - 1] mod 10\n        }\n        m[b + p] += carry\n    }\n    answer = 0\n    for r = p+q to 1\n        answer = answer10 + m[r]\n    return answer\n}\n\nAliens cannot hear any large number, so they want to hear the output modulo Mod, where Mod is some integer.\n\nIf Jalebi Bai gives a wrong output, she would be eaten up! (Surprise surprise!)\n\nJalebi Bai can contact someone on earth for help. She reaches you for a code which can evaluate the output for any given input.

There\'s only one disadvantage in living there: traveling in La La Land is a nightmare. \n\nLa La Land is a rectangular grid with dimensions r\\times c (r rows, c columns). Each cell can only have one of three colors: black, red, and white. And as you know, ants are colored either black or red. But because the mayor of La La Land is a bit crazy, he requires every walking ant in La La Land to follow these rules:\n\n- A walking ant must always be facing in one of the four cardinal directions: north, south, east and west.\n- A walking ant that goes into a white cell must keep walking forward, not changing directions. \n- A walking ant that goes into a non-white cell with the same color as itself must turn left 90 degrees exactly once, and then keep walking forward.\n- A walking ant that goes into a non-white cell with a different color from itself must turn right 90 degrees exactly once, and then keep walking forward.\n- A walking ant that goes off the grid is foolish. It is very hard to go back into La La Land without tons of paperwork, so we can assume that a walking ant that goes off the grid will stay outside the grid forever.\n\nAs you can see, once an ant begins walking, it doesn\'t really have any choice. The ant\'s path is fully determined by the grid.\n\nMy ant is a black ant, and he wants to build a house in one of the cells in La La Land, and live there with his friend, which is a red ant. They also want to build their garage in one of the cells. The mayor has additional rules regarding houses and garages:\n\n- There must be exactly one house and one garage.\n- The cells containing the house and the garage must be different.\n- The cells containing the house and the garage must be white cells.\n- The house must have exactly one door, and it must point in one of the four cardinal directions. Thus, any walking ant leaving the house will be facing in that direction.\n\nLuckily, the garage can be entered from any direction, and the house and the garage cells don\'t have to be adjacent to each other.\n\nFurthermore, my ant and his friend behave in the following way:\n\n- If they reach the cell containing the house again, they just keep walking forward (since that cell is white). Note that this is not considered as \"walking out of the house\", so in particular, they will keep their current direction and not switch to the direction of the door.\n- _As soon as_ they reach the cell containing the garage, they immediately stop walking. (They will then ride their car. Yes, these ants are rich.)\n\nMy ant, which is a black ant, has a special subset B of the cells that he wants to visit every time he walks out from his house. His friend, which is a red ant, also has a special subset R of the cells that she wants to visit every time she walks out from her house. They may optionally visit other cells outside their special subset, but they must visit all cells in their special subset. Also, they must end their walk at the garage. \n\nYou are friends with the mayor, and so you managed to talk him into changing the colors of the cells for you. The mayor has given you complete freedom to choose the color of every cell in the grid with only one restriction: since the mayor is a red ant, he doesn\'t like black, so he requires the final grid to have at most 11 black cells.\n\nHelp my ant and his friend achieve their dream, foolish as they may seem, by choosing the coloring of the grid (subject to the mayor\'s restriction), choosing the locations of the house and the garage, and choosing where the door of the house points to.

In this case y is an attacker of z.  \nii.Given the attack routes of all y not belonging to S, each stronghold x belonging to S may decide to defend one of its neighbors, say z,  in which case x is a defender of z.

All the three children will have to write an integer from the interval [both end points inclusive], and the child whose chosen number is the middle number when all the three numbers are sorted, wins the game, and hence the larger cake.\n\nIf there is a tie for the middle number, the father would choose the winner uniform randomly from all the three children.

So they started to study behaviour of the factorial function.  \n\nFor example, they defined the function Z. For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers N_1 < N_2 then  Z(N_1) <= Z(N_2). It is because we can never \"lose\" any\ntrailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros.

To unlock the door, the monk only sees a hole in it, a lever, and he also spots a very large amount of little round stones on the ground, and he understands that the only way to open the door is to place an exact pre-determined amount of stones trough that hole, so that when the number is correct, he will push the lever down, and the door will open. If this number is incorrect, the lever will be locked by the incorrect stones and a whole new century must pass so that the storms can erode the stones and a new monk can be selected for the task.\n\nThis year, YOU were the one selected to climb the huge set of stairs, and you are extremely well prepared... You have done your training very well and you are also aware of two very important facts that will be key for your success...

You also know that the number of stones you need to place on the door hole is related to the way everyone climbs the stairs and with the number of stairs itself. \n\nAs the monks take several supplies for the demanding trip, they can only climb either one or two steps at a time. You understood that the number of stones you need to place on the door is closely related with the way you climb the stairs. Suppose the number of stairs you need to climb is N. Also, let the number of ways you have of climbing those N stairs be M. Now, the number of stones required is equal to the number of 1\'s in the base-2 representation of (M modulo 1000000007).\n\nYou won\'t fail, as you are extremely well ready, but you have made everyone on your town extremely excited with your journey, so, given the number N of steps you are to climb and a guess, G, from the people of your village, you need to see if they are correct or not.\n\nMore formally, given a number N of steps to climb and a guess G from your village, you need to check if guess G is accordingly to your correct calculations. They are correct if you manage to enter the temple using their guess, or incorrect otherwise. You should output the string “CORRECT” if they are correct, or “INCORRECT” if they are incorrect.

In other words, C[i] = max{A[i], B[i]} for i from 1 to |A|. After that he removes from C all non-lucky digits saving the order of the remaining (lucky) digits. So C now becomes a lucky string. For example, if after reordering A = \"754\" and B = \"873\", then C is at first \"874\" and then it becomes \"74\".\n\n\n\nThe Little Elephant wants the resulting string to be as lucky as possible. The formal definition of this is that the resulting string should be the lexicographically greatest possible string among all the strings that can be obtained from the given strings A and B by the described process.\n\n\nNotes\n|A| denotes the length of the string A.\nA[i] denotes the i-th digit of the string A. Here we numerate the digits starting from 1. So 1 ≤ i ≤ |A|.\nThe string A is called lexicographically greater than the string B if either there exists some index i such that A[i] > B[i] and for each j < i we have A[j] = B[j], or B is a proper prefix of A, that is, |A| > |B| and first |B| digits of A coincide with the corresponding digits of B.\n'),(20021,'AGECAL',''),(27786,'FEMA2','\n\nChef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma).

It may be The End of the Universe!!!\nAliens had stolen the important data about the Birth of the Human beings and they kept this data in their secured Data Center. With the help of these data along with the advanced technologies Aliens had initiated a project called It\'s The End to get rid of the human beings and occupy the Earth.\n\nOn the other side, Chef Po is a good and very well-known Hacker. He is a great human lover, so he decided to get the data back from the Aliens by hacking their Data Center.\n\nThe Aliens Data Center contains various servers arranged in N rows and N columns and the Master Server will be at the last row and the last column of the Data Center. Denote the server at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column of the Data Center as Server[i][j] (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N). So in this notation Master Server is Server[N][N]. Two servers are connected to each other if they are located either at the same row and consecutive columns or at the same column and consecutive rows. In other words, Server[i][j] and Server[i-1][j] are connected to each other for all i and j such that 2 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ N. Also Server[i][j] and Server[i][j-1] are connected to each other for all i and j such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 2 ≤ j ≤ N.\n\nAliens had divided the Data File with the data about the Birth of the Human beings into N * N parts denoted as F[i][j] (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N) and placed the part F[i][j] at the Server[i][j]. Each server has a password which is some non-negative integer. Chef Po needs to crack all the servers in order to get all parts of the Data File.\n\nAliens are really strange beings so they single out three types of passwords:\nPrime Password, which is the prime number. The list of prime numbers starts as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ...\nEven Password, which is the even non-prime number. This list starts as 0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ... Note, that we exclude 2 since it is a prime.\nOdd Password, which is the odd non-prime number. This list starts as 1, 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, 35, 39, 45, 49, ... So it is the list of all odd positive numbers where primes are excluded.For simplicity we call server secured by the Even Password as Even Server. Similarly we define notion of Odd Server and Prime Server.\n\nEach Odd or Even server has a friendly screen with the color indicator. Assume that you enter the password trying to guess the actual password at this server. Then indicator will become green if you enter the number which is smaller than the actual password, it will become red if your number is greater than the actual password or you will get the access to the server (and, thus, to the needed part of the Data File) if the password is correct.\n\nOn the other hand, each Prime Server has no such screen and the only way to crack it is to try all prime numbers until you find out the correct password. So our Chef simply iterate over the list of primes in increasing order and try them until he finds the correct password.\n\nProbably most of you think that to crack servers with friendly screen Chef Po will use binary search. But he is quite weird Hacker and doesn\'t know this concept. To crack server with the friendly screen he will use the following strategy. He will try all even numbers starting from 0 (even number 2) until he either finds the correct password or the indicator becomes red which automatically would mean that the password is odd and equals to the K-1 where K is the even number that was entered at last. So he enters K-1 in the latter case and get the access to the server.\n\nLet\'s consider some examples.\nLet the password be 4. It is an Even Password so Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even or Odd. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4 making 2 unsuccessful tries.\nLet the password be 9. It is an Odd Password so again Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is either Even Server or Odd Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 9 making 6 unsuccessful tries. Note that after he enters 8 the indicator becomes green indicating that the password is greater than 8, on the other hand, after he enters 10 the indicator becomes red indicating that the password is less than 10. Since the only integer number greater than 8 and less than 10 is 9 he will enter it at the last step getting the access to the server.\nFinally, let the password be 11. It is a Prime Password so Chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is Prime Server. Hence he will try passwords in the order 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 making 4 unsuccessful tries.The Alien Data Center has very interesting vulnerability, that Chef has noticed by analyzing Alien\'s secured correspondence. If Chef crack some Even Server S then all Even Servers connected to S become cracked as well, and all Even Servers connected to these servers also become cracked and so on. More formally, the Even Server S\' becomes cracked if it is connected with S via possibly other Even Servers. That is, there exists a sequence of Even Servers such that each two consecutive servers in this sequence are connected, the first server is S and the last server is S\'. Chef calls this vulnerability as \"Grid Hacking Mechanism\". The same is true for Odd Servers. By it is no longer true for Prime Servers. So each Prime Server should be cracked individually.\n\nNow the final tactic for Chef is the following.\nHe will consider the servers in row-major order.\nThat is, at first he consider servers of the first row in the order Server[1][1], Server[1][2], ..., Server[1][N]. Then he considers servers of the second row in the order Server[2][1], Server[2][2], ..., Server[2][N] and so on until he reaches the last server in the last row (which is the Master Server).\nFor each server he at first check whether it is already cracked by the \"Grid Hacking Mechanism\".\nIf yes then he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and move on.\nOtherwise he checks for the friendly screen at this server and apply one of the cracking tactics described above.\nThat is, when he sees the friendly screen he will enter even numbers starting from zero until he finds the password in the way described above. After that he gathers the corresponding part of the Data File and also some other servers become cracked by the \"Grid Hacking Mechanism\".\nAnd when he doesn\'t see the screen he will enter prime numbers in increasing order until he finds the password. After that he again gathers the corresponding part of the Data File but no other servers become cracked since \"Grid Hacking Mechanism\" does not work for Prime Servers.\nFinally he will reach the Master Server, crack it and gather the last part of the Data File.But the only way to recombine the original file is to use special Alien utility called winripzar on the Master Server. It also has the password. Chef Po is a great hacker, so he found out using his special skills that the password for winripzar equals to the number of unsuccessful tries used by him to crack all the servers in the Data Center.\n\nAfter cracking all the servers and gathering all the parts of the Data File Chef became so happy that forgot the number of unsuccessful tries he made during this cracking marathon. But he noted down passwords for all the servers and now asks you for help. Calculate the number of unsuccessful tries Chef did during cracking of all the servers and let him save the Earth!\n\n'),(25281,'CHCBOX','\n\nChef just got a box of chocolates as his birthday gift.

He wants to place N colored cherries around the cake in a circular manner. As all great chefs do, Doom doesn\'t want any two adjacent cherries to have the same color. Chef has unlimited supply of cherries of K ≤ 10 different colors. Each color is denoted by the digit from the set {0, 1, ..., K – 1}. Different colors are denoted by different digits. Some of the cherries are already placed and the Chef wants you to place cherries in the remaining positions. He understands that there can be many such arrangements, so in the case when the answer is not unique he asks you to find the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\n\nLet\'s numerate positions for the cherries by the numbers 1, 2, ..., N starting from one of the positions in a clockwise direction. Then the current (possibly partial) arrangement of the cherries can be represented by a string of N characters. For each position i of the arrangement if the cherry of the color C is placed at this position then the ith character of the string is equal to the digit C. Otherwise, it is equal to the question mark ?. We identify the arrangement with the string that represents it.\n\n\n\nOne arrangement is called lexicographically smaller than the other arrangement if at the first position where they differ the first one has smaller digit (we compare only complete arrangements so we don\'t care about relation between digits and the question mark). For example, the arrangement 1230123 is lexicographically smaller than 1231230 since they have first 3 equal characters but the 4th character in the first arrangement is 0 and it is less than 1 which is the 4th character of the second arrangement.\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n The cherries at the first and the last positions are adjacent to each other (recall that we have a circular cake).\n In the case N = 1 any arrangement is valid as long as the color used for the only cherry of this arrangement is less than K.\n Initial arrangement can be already invalid (see the case 3 in the example).\n\n\n\n\nJust to make all things clear. You will be given a usual string of digits and question marks. Don\'t be confused by circular stuff we have in this problem. You don\'t have to rotate the answer once you have replaced all question marks by the digits. Think of the output like the usual string for which each two consecutive digits must be different but having additional condition that the first and the last digits must be also different (of course if N > 1).\n\n\n\nNext, you don\'t have to use all colors. The only important condition is that this string should be lexicographically smaller than all other strings that can be obtained from the input string by replacement of question marks by digits and of course it must satisfy conditions on adjacent digits.\n\n\n\nOne more thing, K here is not the length of the string but the number of allowed colors. Also we emphasize that the given string can have arbitrary number of question marks. So it can have zero number of question marks as well as completely consists of question marks but of course in general situation it can have both digits and question marks.\n\n\n\nOK. Let\'s try to formalize things in order to make all even more clear. You will be given an integer K and a string S=S[1]S[2]...S[N] where each S[i] is either the decimal digit less than K or the question mark. We are serious. In all tests string S can have only digits less than K. Don\'t ask about what to do if we have digit ≥ K. There are no such tests at all! We guarantee this! OK, let\'s continue. Your task is to replace each question mark by some digit strictly less than K. If there were no question marks in the string skip this step. Now if N=1 then your string is already valid. For N > 1 it must satisfy the following N conditions S[1] ≠ S[2], S[2] ≠ S[3], ..., S[N-1] ≠ S[N], S[N] ≠ S[1]. Among all such valid strings that can be obtained by replacement of question marks you should choose lexicographically smallest one.

They also choose the mines to work in independently from each other and they may work in the same mine at the same time. Mining gold is a continuous process, i.e. if a miner works for t days (where t is a real number) in a mine where this miner has mining speed g gold per day, then he will mine g \\cdot t gold. Obviously, it is impossible to work in a mine after no gold remains in it. For example, if a gold mine contains 30 gold and Chef needs 2 days to completely mine it, but he spends 1 day in it, then he will mine 15 gold; if Chefu needs 1 day to completely mine the same gold mine, and both Chef and Chefu start working in this mine at the same time, it will be empty after 2/3 days ― Chefu will mine 20 gold, while Chef will mine 10 gold.\n\nAt each point of time, both Chef and Chefu know the gold mine in which the other miner is working. Each of them wants to gather the maximum amount of gold for himself.

The game is as follows:\n The game is a two-player game which is played on an NxM grid. \n Each cell of the grid has a certain number of candies. A[i][j] denotes the number of candies in the jth column of the ith row. \n The players make alternate turns. \n In each turn, a player must remove one complete row or one complete column from the grid. He will add all the candies in that row/column into his account. \n The only possible rows that a player can remove in his/her turn are the top row or the bottom row. Similarly, only leftmost column or the rightmost column can be removed in one turn. \n After removing the row or column, the game is played on the new reduced grid with one less row or column respectively. \n When the entire matrix is emptied, the player with higher number of candies wins the game and can take all those candies with him/her. The loser has to give back the candies collected so far and return empty-handed. \n If both players have equal number of candies, both of them are declared winners. \nAlice and Bob want to take as many candies home as possible.

For example, if all these 4 rows/columns have the same number of candies, she will remove the first row in this turn. \n Bob chooses an optimal strategy through which he maximizes his share of candies in the end of the game.

He has recently joined Digital Circuits Course in his school. He is absolutely fascinated by digital circuits, and stays back in lab after school hours to make circuits.

The holes are arranged as following-\n\nHoles in a group of 5 share a common metallic plate, i.e if one of them gets a high voltage, then all 5 of them are at \"High\". The group is aligned vertically.\n\n\nThere are several groups placed horizontally as well as vertically, depending on the dimensions of the Jam Board.\n\n\nFor illustration, consider a Jam Board Having 6 Columns and 2 Rows-\nA B C D E F\nA B C D E F\nA B C D E F\nA B 1 D E F\nA B C D 2 F\nG H I J K L\nG H I J K L\nG H I J K L\nG 3 I J K L\nG H I J K L\n\nAll A\'s are in a group, and share same voltage.

It is (2, 9), from Top Left.\nNow if Jimmy plugs one end of copper wire in 1 and the other in 2, then C and E will become a single group and start sharing voltage. Jimmy can apply a high voltage to any hole, and that group becomes \"high\". The Jam Board is grounded, thus each group is initially at low voltage. When an LED is connected across two points, it glows up if there is a potential difference between the two points, i.e. when one end is \"high\" and the other is \"low\".\n\n\nThe lab assistant must leave, but he allows Jimmy to stay with one Jam Board, one LED, one Voltage sources (with several output points) and lots of wires. So Jimmy gets down to work, he connects wires, applies (high) voltage, and occasionally connects the LED between two points. Sometimes he removes a voltage source as well. At times he connects a wire(or voltage source) to the point, which already has a wire(or voltage source) connected to it. This is not a good practice, but Jimmy is excused because he is new to electrical stuff.

They have played so many games that this number doesn\'t fit in \n\na standard 32-bit integer type. Today Loda and Maelk are going to sort the things out and find out who is the \n\ngreatest ChefCraft player ever. So the great fight is coming. There are a lot of different heroes you may \n\nchoose to play ChefCraft. Obviously every hero has his pros and cons. Loda perfectly plays Blade Master. His \n\nmain skill is to make mirror images of himself to spoof the enemy.\n\n\n\nAs every other popular game ChefCraft is played on a rectangular grid which consists of N rows and \n\nM columns. Rows of the grid are numbered by integers from 1 to N. So the upper row of the \n\ngrid has number 1 and the lower row has number N. The same holds for columns. They are numbered \n\nby integers from 1 to M such that the most left column has number 1 while the most right \n\ncolumn has number M.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the game the only Blade Master\'s image stands on some starting cell (Sx, Sy) where \n\n1 ≤ Sx ≤ N and 1 ≤ Sy ≤ M. Then Loda makes T moves. Maelk knows how the \n\ndistribution of images on the grid changes after each Loda\'s move. This happens according to the following \n\nrules.\n\n\n\n1. If there is an image standing on the cell (i, j) then the new images appear by the next \n\nrules:\n\n\n\nLet F(i, j) be the total number of images in the \"cross\" of the cell (i, j). The \"cross\" of \n\nthe cell (i, j) is union of all cells in the i-th row of the grid and in the j-th column \n\nof the grid. So N + M − 1 cells belongs to the \"cross\".\n\nLet X = F(i, j) mod 6, that is X is the remainder of the division of F(i, j) by \n\n6.\n\nFor every possible value of X we have following values: D1, D2, P1  and \n\nP2.\n\nD1 and D2 may be equal to one of the 4 values [\'U\', \'R\', \'D\', \'L\'] and mean \n\nsome two directions. Here \'U\' means up, \'R\' means right, \'D\' means \n\ndown and \'L\' means left.\n\nP1 and P2 are integer numbers.\n\nNew mirror images will appear at every cell in the direction D1 with the period P1 starting \n\nfrom cell (i, j) and in the direction D2 with the period P2 also starting from the cell \n\n(i, j). Of course, no images will appear out of the grid. For example, if D1 = \'U\' and P1 = \n\n2 then images appear at the cells (i − 2, j), (i − 4, j), (i − 6, j), and so \n\non.\n\nLoda always use the same values for D1 and D2. Namely,\nD1 = \'U\', D2 = \'D\' for X = 0,\nD1 = \'L\', D2 = \'R\' for X = 1,\nD1 = \'U\', D2 = \'R\' for X = 2,\nD1 = \'R\', D2 = \'D\' for X = 3,\nD1 = \'D\', D2 = \'L\' for X = 4,\nD1 = \'L\', D2 = \'U\' for X = 5.\n\nBut values P1 and P2 may vary for different games. But once chosen they will be the same for \n\nall moves.\n\n\n\n2. Appearing of new mirror images happens immediately.\n\n\n\n3. Whenever there is more than one image at the cell they start one on one fights. In each fight two \n\nimages participate and both die. So if the number of images in the cell was even than all images will \n\ndisappear in the end, otherwise exactly one image will remain at this cell.\n\n\n\nNow Maelk wants to choose his hero in order to win the fight. The most important thing he needs to know for \n\nthis is how the number of images changes during Loda\'s moves. So he asks you for help. Denote by C(t) \n\nthe number of images on the grid after the t-th Loda\'s move for t from 1 to T. For \n\nconvenience we denote C(0) = 1 with meaning that 0-th move is the putting of the only Blade \n\nMaster\'s image at the starting cell.

As you remember the total number of games played by Maelk and Loda at ChefCraft doesn\'t fit in a \n\nstandard 32-bit integer type. Of course, the same can hold for the number of moves in their final fight. Since \n\nMaelk plays ChefCraft the whole life he is not strong in math and can\'t calculate such large sums.

There are N Chefs in the kitchen besides the Chief Chef. Every Chef in the kitchen has an index.\n\nThe index of the Chief Chef is 0. Remaining N chefs have indices between 1 and N and no two chefs have the same index. As any other kitchen in the street, every chef has exactly one Immediate-Superior and can have any number of Superiors above him. A chef (say A) is Superior of another chef (say B) if either A is the Immediate-Superior of B or A is the Superior of Immediate-Superior of B. The Chief Chef is on the top position and Superior to all N chefs and has no Superior above him.\nIf A is Immediate-Superior of B, then B is called Immediate-Inferior of A. If A is Superior of B then B is called Inferior of A (See the example for better explanation).\nEvery chef makes exactly one dish daily. There is a small custom in the kitchen that every day each chef should taste the dishes made by all his superiors on that day. So if our Chief Chef swaps the dish made by Chef A with a poisonous one, every Inferior of A will taste this dish on that day and get poisoned. Every poisonous dish has some specific sickness value X and the health of every chef poisoned by it decreases by X on that day. As soon as the health of a chef drops to zero or less, he dies.\n\nWhen a chef dies in the kitchen, Chief Chef recruits a new chef to replace the dead chef, so the Immediate Superior and all the Immediate Inferiors of the dead chef will become the Immediate Superior and Immediate Inferiors of the new chef respectively. The newly recruited chefs are very healthy. In fact, you can assume that they have infinite health.\nChef has made some poison recipes and has some queries for you. He asks you one query per day for Q continuous days. He has two types of queries: 1) He gives you two integers A and X which means that he wants to make the dish made by A poisonous on that day with a poison of sickness value X. 2) He gives you one integer A. In this type of query he wants to know how many chefs among the inferiors of A are old chefs, i.e, not newly recruited chefs.\n\nRemember that chef can also poison the dish made by himself, which will be tasted by all N chefs.\n\n'),(7937,'CYLINDER','\nChef wants to make a steel container.

In case you\'re not, here\'s a short description. The game is played on a rectangular grid with R rows and C columns. Some cells contain mines and the others are empty. Initially, all cells are closed - their content is hidden. A player has to open all empty cells without opening a cell which contains a mine. You can open a cell by clicking on it. Opening an empty cells displays a number of mines in the neighbouring 8 cells. In case there aren\'t any mines in the neighbourhood, all neighbouring cells are automatically opened. This way you can open large mine-free areas with a single click.\n\nAs the name of this problem suggests, you will be dealing with a reversed process of minesweeping. A player starts with a grid where all cells are open and are either empty or contain a mine. The goal of this reversed game is to hide the mines by closing all cells as fast as possible. There are two ways to close a cell. You can either click on it or the cell can automatically close as a result of clicking on some other cell. Clicking on a cell C1 closes all cells C2 which could open simultaneously with C1 in a normal game of Minesweeper (as a result of a single click somewhere on the grid). More formally, let Sx,y be a set of all cells which are opened when you click on the cell (x,y) in a normal game of Minesweeper. Clicking on a cell C1 will also close all cells C2 such that there exists a set Sx,y which contains both C1 and C2. You can safely click on a mine cell to close it.

Selecting a good team is not about having the best people, but it is about having members who can cooperate and work well with each other. Chef is very aware of this fact. So he chooses the following strategy to decide a team. He lines up all his N cooks in a line. Each of these cooks has a skill level associated with him.

But Chef is a human and can\'t evaluate too many teams. The maximal number of teams he can evaluate depends on many factors such as his mood or fatigue. We call it the Chef\'s limit. Denote the current Chef\'s limit as M. Since Chef still wants the total number of candidate teams to be as large as possible you need to find the team size K such that cand[K] ≤ M, among all such K find the value for which cand[K] is maximal and if such K is not unique find the minimal K among them.

This polyline divides the set of points \\{(x, z): 1 <= x <= N\\} into two regions.

Caroline doesn\'t want to place any vertices on the coordinate axes -- so each vertex should be assigned to one of four quadrants; moreover, if we count the number of vertices in each quadrant and write down these four numbers, no two of these numbers should differ by more than 1 (so Caroline wants to distribute the vertices among quadrants as equally as possible).  She would also like no two vertices to coincide.\n\nOut of all drawings satisfying the given requirements, Caroline would like to choose a drawing with the minimal number of intersections between graph edges and coordinate axes. Note that if an edge intersects the origin (0;0), it\'s counted as one intersection, and if an edge intersects both axes at different points, it\'s counted as two intersections. Also note that if two edges intersect either of the axes in the same point, an intersection is counted for both edges.\n\nCaroline doesn\'t care about the thing that the edges may intersect, overlap, contain vertices or even each other inside. She considers all the graphs satisfying all the requirements equally good.\n\nIt\'s easy to guess now what you are to do in this problem.\n\n'),(18260,'TREE3','\n\nKefaa has developed a novel decomposition of a tree.

Seeing a business opportunity, Chef has built a brand new Hotel Balifornia there. The hotel has R unique comfortable rooms for guests\' purpose. The rooms are numbered by integers from 0 to R-1, inclusive. All rooms in the hotel are on the same floor and arranged in a circle. Namely,\nthe room next to the room 0 is the room 1;\nthe room next to the room 1 is the room 2;\n...\nthe room next to the room R-2 is the room R-1;\nfinally, the room next to the room R-1 is the room 0.\nWhen R = 1 we have only one room and it is next to itself.\nBelow, we will be needing the notion of k-th next room to the given room. It should be quite clear from the notation what does it mean but let\'s define it formally to avoid any ambiguities. The 1-st next room to the room r is simply the next room to the room r. Assume that the notion of (k-1)-th next room is already defined. Then the k-th next room to the room r is the room next to the (k-1)-th next room to the room r.\nAt the time of check-in, among other things, the guest is required to provide his first name and the number of hours he will be staying in the hotel. Chef has sent a special machine called \"Room Number Generator\" (RNG) for allocating the rooms to the guests. The RNG takes a string (the first name of the guest) as the input and returns the room id. This is how RNG does it:\nThe string is composed of lowercase and uppercase letters of English alphabet.\nAt first, uppercase letters (from \'A\' to \'Z\', inclusive) are replaced by the corresponding lowercase letters: \'A\' by \'a\', \'B\' by \'b\', ..., \'Z\' by \'z\'.\nNext, each letter is replaced by an integer value: \'a\' by 1, \'b\' by 2, ..., \'z\' by 26.\nThen we consider thus obtained list of positive integers as a representation of some integer in base 33. Namely, if D1, D2, ..., DL is the list of integers obtained after encoding all the letters we will consider the following value: D1  33L-1 + D2  33L-2 + ... + DL-1  33 + DL.\nFinally, RNG takes the remainder of division of the number, obtained at the previous step, by the number of rooms in the hotel. So this will be (D1  33L-1 + D2  33L-2 + ... + DL-1  33 + DL) mod R. This value is the room id returned by RNG. Well, at least Chef deems that RNG returns this value...\n\nConsider some examples:\n\"Ab\" will be at first replaced by \"ab\" and then will be represented as 1  33 + 2 = 35. If the number of rooms in the hotel is 40 then the room will be 35 mod 40 = 35.\n\"Chef\" will be at first replaced by \"chef\" and then will be represented as 3  333 + 8  332 + 5  33 + 6 = 116694. If the number of rooms in the hotel is 37 then the room will be 116694 mod 37 = 33.\nChef noted that for some unlucky values of R regardless of the name of the guest, RNG returns only rooms from some range that does not cover all rooms in the hotel. This, of course, would be disaster for Chef. For example, for R = 33 rooms 0, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 can not be the values returned by RNG. Chef is smart guy and quickly realizes that this happens if and only if R is divisible by 33. Hence he ensures that the number of rooms in the hotel is not divisible by 33.\nThe hotel manager was having fun time, \'RNGing\' the names of his acquaintances, just when he discovered that his wife\'s RNG number came out the same as his friend\'s! Horrified he visited the VP and explained the problem that different guests may end up in the same room. The VP thought for a moment, and then suggested that the one who comes later be allotted a different room. How clever! But which room? The hotel management fought for several days over this. Ultimately the lift boy\'s scheme was taken up.\n\nThe lift boy is fond of sequences and number theory. Hence he will use the following sequence in his scheme: 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, ... Here each term of the sequence, starting from the 4-th one, equals to the sum of three previous terms. We denote the n-th term of this sequence as An. So A1 = 1, A2 = 2, A3 = 3, A4 = 6, and so on.\nAssume that RNG number of the current guest is r0.\nAt first we check the room r0 and if it is free we settle guest in this room.\nOtherwise, we check the room r1 which is A1-th next to the room r0. If it is free we settle guest in this room. Note that since A1 = 1 then, actually, r1 is simply the next room to r0.\nOtherwise, we check the room r2 which is A2-th next to the room r1. If it is free we settle guest in this room. Note that since A2 = 2 then, r2 is the room, next to the room that is next to the room r1 (ignore this, if it blows your mind).\nIn general, at k-th step we have all rooms r0, r1, ..., rk-1 occupied and we check the room rk which is Ak-th next to the room rk-1. If it is free we settle guest in this room and finish the process. Otherwise we continue.\nIf we can\'t find the free room in any finite number of steps, we inform the guest that we unable to settle him. In this case we provide him the minimal number of minutes after which he could come again so that we could find the free room for him by the above scheme, assuming that we start the process again from the room r0.\nPlease, be sure that you are using exactly this definition to find the required number of minutes. According to some weird facts about \'RNG\' below, the room \'RNGing\' to the guest later could differ from r0, but we still use the old value to perform the lift boy\'s scheme.\nActually, no guest will return back to the hotel if we ask him to come back later without settling him in some room. The reason is that only celebrities visit Chef\'s hotel (see the example ;)) and they take a huge offense to the Chef if they were not settled in any room. Hence they will never return to the hotel again in this case. So actually we inform them the minimal number of minutes just out of courtesy :)\n\nChef hears this and is a bit worried about guests\' response, so he requests you to analyze the inconvenience that will be caused to the guests. If the guest was settled in some room, the inconvenience equals to the least integer k for which the room rk is free, so, actually, it is the number of rooms that was found occupied while processing this guest. Otherwise it is equal to the number of minutes he should wait to come again if no free room was found for him by lift boy\'s scheme. \nAfter invention of the lift boy\'s scheme Chef also realizes that his old fears about unlucky values of R is useless but still he believes that values of R divisible by 33 could lead to larger average guests\' inconvenience than other values of R. So, just in case, he still ensures that R is not divisible by 33.\nWhat Chef and hotel management does not realize is that RNG has a mind of its own. Don\'t get scared! It just remembers the inconvenience caused to each guest and it uses this information to adjust the returned value. Namely, RNG add to the initial RNG value described above the sum of inconveniences caused to all previous guests. Then this number is taken modulo R to get the correct room number and RNG returns it. See example for clarity.\nYou will be given the list of all visits to the Hotel Balifornia in increasing order of time and should output the inconvenience caused to each guest. To make the output more readable print the dash before the inconvenience of each guest that was not settled in any room.\nAlso note that Chef\'s hotel is very popular, so the time interval between two consecutive visits is strictly less than 24 hours. Hence we will be providing only hour and minute of the day for each visit.\nWe could have several visits at the same moment of time. In this case we process guests in order they appear in the input.\n If we have a visiting guest and some other guest leaving the hotel at the same moment, then the room which will be vacated by the leaving guest will be considered as free when applying the lift boy\'s scheme to the visiting guest. The same is true when deciding the waiting minutes for not settled guests.\nWe assume that all guests are different. But they could have equal first names. Indeed, Daniel Craig and Daniel Radcliffe are different persons having equal first names :)\n\n'),(14859,'RNDGRID',' \n\nDon\'t miss the \"Tests Generation\" section.\nThe input is generated in a special way for this problem.\n\nBear Limak lives in a square grid that consists of N rows and N columns.\nEach cell is either empty or blocked, denoted with character \'.\' or \'#\' respectively.\nLimak can only visit empty cells and he can\'t move outside the grid.\n\nLimak wants to impress a girl he likes.\nHe should make a sequence of moves described by a string S of length L.\nEach character is one of \'R\', \'L\', \'U\', \'D\', denoting directions: right, left, up and down respectively.\n\nDepending on the starting cell, making all L moves might be impossible.\nLimak considers each empty cell as a starting one and wonders how many  moves in the sequence he can make, before being forced to stop.\nFor example, if S starts with \'R\' but a cell on the right from the starting cell is blocked (or is outside the grid), Limak would do 0 moves.\n\nYour task is to find the number of moves Limak would do from each starting cell, and print the bitwise XOR of those numbers.\n\n\n\nTests Generation\n\nThe input in this problem is generated as follows.\nFor each test case we manually chose only three values: two integers L and N and one real value P (0 ≤ P < 1).\nEach character in S is chosen (generated) uniformly at random from the four allowed characters.\nEach cell in the grid is blocked with probability P, and empty otherwise.\nIf all cells are blocked, the test case is generated again, so it is guaranteed that at least one cell is empty.\n\n\n\n'),(10014,'DEVHAND',' \n\n\n\nAs you have probably realized up to now that Devu is not a normal guy, he is a very weird and abnormal guy.

A customer who has spent many minutes deciding between menu items can get quite annoyed when they place the order and the server tells them the item is not available. To mitigate this effect, the Chef declares that all servers must have what he calls a \"backup function\". This is a function f from menu items to menu items. For each menu item x, f(x) is an alternative menu item that the server may suggest to the customer in the event the customer requests menu item x when x is not available.\n\n\nOf course, if a given item is not available then some other items make better suggestions than others. So, for some pairs of items x and y the Chef has determined a numeric value describing the effectiveness of the assignment f(x) = y. Higher values indicate the proposed substitute is similar to the original and lower values indicate the proposed substitute is not very similar to the original. Such effectiveness values are symmetric meaning that if the effectiveness of assignment f(x) = y is v, then the effectiveness of the assignment f(y) = x is also v.\n\n\nYou will be given a list of pairs of menu items.

This is a midnight question of biological scientists. The number of pairs of different characters in the same position may be a good indicator. However, it will not work well in the case when two strings have different lengths.

Call the first string as A and the second string as B. Let S be the set of all different substrings of A, and T be the set of all different substrings of B. We then define another set P which consists of all the strings that belongs to S or T, but not both. According to the Professor L.P.C. method, the size of P is a good indicator to measure the difference between A and B.\n\n\n\nFor example, let A = aacd and B = cdaa.

If no such integer C exists then result of division is undefined, which means that error occurs during the calculation.\n32-bit power A ^ B is defined as follows. For B > 0 we define A ^ B = A  A  ...  A, where A repeats B times (here  is a 32-bit multiplication). For B = 0 we define A ^ 0 = 1. Finally, for B < 0 we define A ^ B = 1 / (A ^ (-B)), where A ^ (-B) is defined above (-B is the usual negation of B) and / is a 32-bit division operation.

A (here  is a 32-bit multiplication). For A = 0 we define 0! = 1. Finally, for A < 0 we define A! = (-1)  (-2)  (-3)  ...

Therefore,\nthe most priority operation is factorial (!),\nthe second most priority operation is exponentiation (^),\nthe third most priority operation is division (/),\nthe fourth most priority operation is multiplication (*),\nthe fifth most priority operation is addition (+),\nand, finally, the less priority operation is subtraction (-).\n\nWe could abbreviate the list of operations sorted by priority as FEDMAS (the first letter of the title of each operation was chosen).\nThe evaluation of a Zenfix expression goes as follows:\nIf expression contains a factorial sign (!) followed by an integer then we choose the leftmost such occurrence and perform the factorial operation which will be defined below. Namely, we replace the integer that follows the factorial sign by its factorial value and delete the factorial sign from the expression.\nOtherwise, if there exists an operation followed by at least 3 integers we at first choose the first operation in EDMAS with this property (that is, among operations followed by at least three integers we choose the operation with the highest priority). Then we choose the leftmost occurrence of such a case with this operation and perform calculation. Namely, we replace the operation and two following integers by the result of this operation applied to these integers. If error occurs during this calculation then you should stop evaluation of expression.\nOtherwise, if there exists an operation followed by exactly 2 integers we proceed exactly as in the previous rule.\nWe repeat the first three steps until we can no longer repeat them or error occurs during some calculation.\nAt the end of this evaluation, if we are left with a single integer, the expression is called correct, otherwise it is called incorrect.

How could they allow this again?!\" Chef Po has thought and started connecting to the Aliens Data Center to save the Earth again.\n\nThe first thing he noticed is that there are N servers in the Aliens Data Center and they are arranged in a line. Aliens have rearranged the Data Center to avoid \"Grid Hacking Mechanism\" (refer to this, but this is not needed to understand this problem). Denote the i-th server as Server[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ N).\n\nAliens had divided the Data File with the data about the Birth of the Human beings into N parts denoted as F[i] (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and placed the part F[i] at the Server[i]. Each server has a password - a non-negative integer.

Suppose you enter a password trying to guess the actual password of such a server. The indicator will then become green if you enter a number which is smaller than the actual password; it will become red if your number is greater than the actual password, or you will get the access to the server (and, thus, to the needed part of the Data File) if the password is correct.\n\nOn the other hand, each Power Server has no such screen and the only way to crack it is to try all Power Passwords until you find out the correct password. So our Chef simply iterate over the list of Power Passwords in increasing order and try them until he finds the correct password.\n\nAfter the last adventure with Aliens, Chef became smarter so he will use binary search to crack Non-Power Servers.

At first he will try passwords A[2], A[4], A[8], A[16], ... until he either reaches the correct one or the indicator becomes red for the first time. If indicator becomes red at the password A[2] = 1 then he enters A[1] = 0 at the next step and cracks the server (since 0 is the only Non-Power Password less than 1). Let the indicator becomes red at the password A[2k] where k ≥ 2 while for the password A[2k−1] indicator was green. Then Chef sets L = 2k−1, R = 2k and uses usual binary search to crack the server after that. Namely, at each step he sets M = (L + R) div 2 and checks the password A[M]. If it is correct he finishes the process; if indicator becomes green he sets L = M and continue the process; finally, if indicator becomes red he sets R = M and continue the process.\n\nLet\'s consider some examples:\nSuppose the password is 9. It\'s a Power Password, so Chef will not see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is a Power Server. Hence he will try the password 4, then 8 and then 9, making 3 tries in all.\nSuppose the password is 0. It\'s a Non-Power Password, so Chef will see the friendly screen which means for him that the server is a Non-Power Server. Hence he will try the passwords A[2] = 1, A[1] = 0 in order, making 2 tries in all.\nSuppose the password is 7. It\'s a Non-Power Password. Hence he will try the passwords A[2] = 1, A[4] = 3, A[8] = 10, A[6] = 6, A[7] = 7 in order, making 5 tries in all.\nSuppose the password is 1. It\'s a Non-Power Password.

For each query, it was asked to find the number of vertices in the tree (which didn\'t belong to the list) such that if you removed this vertex and all edges incident to it from the tree, then all vertices from the list would belong to pairwise different connected components.\n\nDavid spent seven unhappy days and six sleepless nights trying to solve this problem efficiently.

The second line contains a single integer M followed by a string S2, separated by a space\n\nThe string S1 is the encoded form of the lucky sequence. S1 will contain only characters \'a\' - \'z\' (that stand for values 0 - 25), and \'A\' - \'F\' (that stand for values 26 - 31). To decode S1, concatenate the values as 5-bit binary numbers of each character of S1. Then, replace 0\'s with F\'s and 1\'s with B\'s.

It can be proved that the answers will always be an integer. Since the answers can be very large, output each answer modulo 1,000,000,007.

Connections between planets are mutual and no planet can be connected with itself. The distance between a pair of planets is the least number of connections that you have to pass through while travelling from the first planet to the second.\n\nNow let\'s consider how good galaxies are formed.\n\nInitially there is a galaxy that consists of exactly one planet. At any moment, the galaxy grows by first making a copy of itself; then connecting each planet in the first copy to the corresponding planet in the second copy. Thus a galaxy which has P planets and M connections would grow into a new galaxy with 2P planets and 2M+P connections.\n\nThis diagram shows how the galaxy grows over the first two iterations. Dark grey shows the copy of the galaxy; light grey shows the additional connections.\n\n\n\nHowever, galaxies do not continue growing forever. Why? The answer is simple: comets. At any point after the galaxy has started growing, a comet may pass through the galaxy. When it does, it changes the connections between planets by the following rule:\n\nTwo planets are connected after the comet arrives if and only if the distance between the planets was equal to 2 before the comet arrives.\n\nIt can be shown that a comet will split a growing galaxy into two disconnected galaxies with identical structures.\n\nAfter a comet has arrived, the galaxy stops growing. Researchers have discovered that each of the two identical galaxies formed by the comet are \'good galaxies\' - fit for living. In fact, galaxies formed in this way are the only good galaxies that exist.\n\nThis diagram shows the result when a comet arrives after each of the first three iterations. In each one the red and blue colours show the two equivalent good galaxies.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, nothing lasts forever. For many reasons, such as a second comet appearing, new planets or connections between them may be created or destroyed, resulting in galaxies with many other structures and causing the galaxy to lose its \'good\' status.\n\nYou are given a galaxy with N planets and M connections.

So, a path will start with a heavy segment or a light segment, but the segment types will alternate between heavy and light.\n\nThe length of a segment is the number of edges in it.

Cat Trap (also known as Black Cat, Chat Noir or Circle The Cat).\nThe goal of the game is to prevent a cat from running away.\nLimak loves it because cats are usually afraid of him (for no reason) and don\'t want to play with him.\nYou can try that game yourself: http://www.gamedesign.jp/flash/chatnoir/chatnoir.html.\n\nIn this problem, your task is to win in a modified version of the game.\nThe differences are:\n\n\nThe grid is a regular hexagon of side N = 20.\nInitially no cells are blocked.\nYou must win in M turns (i.e. you can block at most M cells).\nThe cat follows some particular strategy, described below.\n\n\n\nRows are numbered -(N-1) through N-1 from top to bottom, so the row 0 is in the middle.\nColumns are numbered -(N-1) through N-1 from left to right, where the column 0 is the diagonal that contains the first cell of the top row and the last cell of the bottom row.\nFor example, for N = 3 the grid would look like this (blue arrows are pointing at the column 0):\n\n\n\nLet (r, c) denote the cell at the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column.\nThe description above implies that the cell (r,c) has at most six adjacent cells: (r,c+1), (r-1,c+1), (r-1,c), (r,c-1), (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c).\n\nA border cell is a cell with fewer than six adjacent cells (there are exactly 6*(N-1) border cells).\nFor any not-blocked cell X we define the distance to the border as the minimum number of moves the cat would need to reach a border cell, assuming that he starts from X and no more cells will be blocked.\nIn particular, the distance to the border is 0 for all not-blocked border cells.\nThe distance to the border is infinite if a cell is blocked or the cat can\'t reach any border cell.\n\nThe cat starts in the cell (0, 0), i.e. in the middle of the grid.\nIn each turn of the game:\n\n\nThe cat moves first.\nIf he is in a border cell, he runs away and you lose.\nIf he can\'t reach any border cell, you win (i.e. when the cat is in a connected component bounded by blocked cells).\nOtherwise, the cat moves to one of the adjacent cells with the minimum distance to the border.\nFor example, if three adjacent cells are blocked, two cells have the distance to the border equal to 15, and one cell has the distance to the border equal to 17, then the cat chooses one of the two adjacent cells with the distance 15.\nAlso, in the very first move the cat chooses any of six adjacent cells, because all of them have the same distance to the border.\nThen you can block one cell.\nYou can\'t block a cell if it\'s already blocked or it contains the cat.\n\n\n\n\nInteraction\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers T and M denoting the number of test cases and the maximum allowed number of times you can block a cell (per test case).\nAt the beginning of each test case, the cat starts in the cell (0, 0) and no cells are blocked.\n\nWhen the cat is supposed to move, you should read from the input, a line that is either \"WIN\" or \"CAT r c\" (both without the quotes).\nA line \"WIN\" means that the cat can\'t reach the border anymore and you should proceed to the next test case (and again read the first move of the cat), unless it\'s the last test case — then you should terminate your program.\nA line \"CAT r c\" means that the cat moves to the cell (r, c).\n\nAfter the cat moves, you should print a line in the format \"BLOCK r c\" denoting blocking the cell (r, c).\nRemember about printing a newline character and flushing the output.\nYou can\'t skip a move and you can\'t block a cell if it\'s already blocked or it contains the cat.\n\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\nSubtask #1 (35 points) 1 ≤ T ≤ 10, M = 500\nSubtask #2 (65 points) 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, M = 20\n\n\n\n\nVisualizer\n\nYou need Python3 to run the

Chef is currently at position (c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n).

Then he draws a big polygon on it, using crayons. Then in several wild swings, he draws several lines on the board. You may think it is simple, but it is not so. After so many years of experience in slicing potatoes and tomatoes he has become very accurate in marking points on the board. So what is remarkable is, that every corner of the polygon, and every starting and ending point of the line is an integral point, i.e can be represented as  where x and y both are integers. Another point worth pointing out is that Chef believes in symmetry. This is visible from following fact- \"If we divide entire wooden board into 16 square shaped (virtual) regions, the difference in number of lines contained in the region with maximum lines and the region with minimum lines does not exceed 50%\". A region is said to contain a line if at least one end point of line is inside it.\nIt doesn\'t end here.

The painting is ready!\nThe needles and board pins are rather costly, so the Chef neither wants to buy the needles and pins in excess, nor does he want to run short of them.

His competitors in disguise of customers or employees visit his restaurants and create trouble. Chef is extremely agitated. When he calms down he decides to beef up security. The plan is codenamed \"Chef Protection Plan\". Under this plan, everything is checked before being entered into restaurants. After much thinking it was decided to check for identification numbers of cooks, customers, delivery van etc. Various types of identification numbers to be checked are : \"Security number\", \"Employee number\", \"Roll number\" etc.\n\nChef has restaurants all over the world. Different places have different formats for a given identification number and there are too many types of identification numbers. Thus Chef needs to specify the format for all the identification numbers in a convenient way. The format should also be consistent because the code monkeys who will be automating the process are not very careful with specifications. An identification number is composed of uppercase letters and digits and hyphen (\'-\') only. Thus instead of calling it an identification number, we will call it an ID string henceforth.The rules used by Chef for specifying a format of an ID string are (formats are underlined)-\n\nA portion of string can be a fixed string, i.e. matches itself exactly only. Like XYZ, A321, D-409 etc.\nThe specification contains keywords in lowercase to describe the ID string. This is the list of keywords, along with their meaning- - to : is used for specifying a range from a letter to letter or a digit to digit. Like 3 to 8, D to Z etc. Note that ranges of numbers cannot be specified using to. 1 to 1000 is invalid because 1000 is not a digit but a number. Also D to A is invalid because the left-hand-side should not be greater than the right-hand-side. - or : is used to specify a list of exclusive options. Like XYZ or Y2K, 1 or 3 or 55 etc. - times : is used to specify the number of times (N) a portion of the format string is to be repeated. Like A 3 times, S01 12 times etc. The first example can also be specified simply as AAA instead. Thus as you will see there are multiple ways to specify same type of ID strings. Also the portion (to be repeated) is smallest meaningful expression. Like in A B 2 times, \'B\' is repeated 2 times and not \'AB\'. - optional : is used to specify that the string portion is optional, i.e can be present or absent. Like LP optional, 12KL optional etc. Also the portion (to be made optional) is smallest meaningful expression. Like in A B optional, \'B\' is optional and not \'AB\'. - digit : is used to specify any digit. It is same as writing 0 to 9 or 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 in the rule. - letter : is used to specify any letter. It is same as writing A to Z or A or B or C... in the rule. - digits : is used to specify the number of times any digit may be repeated. It can be specified in two ways- -- exactly N digits, where N is an integer. Like exactly 3 digits matches 007 and 987 but not 5 or 42 -- upto N digits, where N is an integer. Like upto 3 digits matches 7, 42 and 987 but not 4444. This rule can also match 0 digits. See the examples below. - letters : is used to specify the number of times any letter may be repeated. It can be specified in two ways- -- exactly N letters, where N is an integer. Like exactly 3 letters matches ABC and CPP but not Z or VG -- upto N letters, where N is an integer. Like upto 3 letters matches A, BC and DEF but not PQRS. This rule can also match 0 letters.\nThe above keywords can be used to describe a portion of the format string. By writing such \"sub-formats\" side by side we can describe entire ID string. Like 3 to 8 XYZ or Y2K matches 4XYZ, 7Y2K etc. but not XYZ, Y2K5 etc.\nThe sub-formats can be nested as well. Like 3 to 8 or Y2K, digit 2 times. Notice that second example is equivalent to exactly 2 digits.\nParentheses can be used to enforce grouping in formats or to provide clarity. Like XYZ 12 or 34 optional makes 34 optional. Instead if you want \'12 or 34\' to be optional, you can use parentheses : XYZ (12 or 34) optional. Parenthesis can also be used when they are not really required. Like ((XYZ)) 234 is equivalent to XYZ 234, which can also be written as XYZ234. Note that () is invalid, because Chef believes empty parenthesis are useless.\nSpaces are used to separate keywords, strings, numbers, digits and letters from each other. Like ABCoptional is invalid, but ABC optional is valid. Spaces are very useful in breaking apart strings, like AB CD 2 times. Parenthesis can also be used for separation, like AB(CD)2 times is same as the last format. But A(to)B is invalid as parenthesis enforce grouping as well and (to) alone is invalid.\n\nNow Chef is lousy at writing formats. Like he can add unnecessary spaces around words. He won\'t add stray symbols though. Also being a human he can sometimes end up writing erroneous formats -- the ones which do not conform to his rules. Like optional ABC, 1 to A etc. are invalid formats. But he would never use symbols apart from lowercase/uppercase letter, digits, parenthesis, hyphen(-) and space.\n\n'),(35517,'PERMXOR','A sequence of N integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to N exactly once.\n\nFor a permutation P of length N (where N is an even integer), we define the function F(P) as:\n\nF(P) =  (P_1 \\oplus P_2)  +  (P_3 \\oplus P_4) +  \\ldots  + (P_{n-1} \\oplus P_n).

He has spent far too many days calculating shortest paths, finding bipartite matchings, minimum cuts, and optimizing over NP-hard problems. He needs a break. Unfortunately for him, the food services industry doesn\'t take breaks. Once again, the Chef has to navigate through an undirected graph to keep his business going.\n\n\nIn this particular problem, the layout of edges in the graph doesn\'t matter very much. All that really matters is the distances between pairs of nodes. Given this, you have a great idea that will help the Chef not worry about graphs at all during this latest task. Rather than presenting the graph to the Chef, you will present something else.\n\n\nAfter some thought, you have settled on the following. You will present the nodes of the graph as distinct points in d-dimensional Euclidean space. Each node v will be represented by a d-tuple of numbers pv = (xv,1, ..., xv,d). The distance between two points is the usual Euclidean distance in d-dimensional space. That is, the distance between two points pu and pv representing nodes u and v is the square root of (xu,1 - xv,1)2 + ... + (xu,d - xv,d)2.\n\n\nThe quality of such an assignment of nodes into points in Euclidean space is measured as follows. Let a(u,v) be the length of the shortest path connecting node u to node v in the graph and let b(u,v) be the distance between points pu and pv in Euclidean space.\nDefine K as the minimum value of b(u,v)/a(u,v) over all pairs of distinct nodes (u,v). Similarily, define L as the maximum value of b(u,v)/a(u,v) over all pairs of distinct nodes (u,v). The quality of the solution is then d*L/K.\n\n\nThe idea behind this measurement is as follows. We want the distances between nodes in Euclidean space to be close to their distances in the original graph. So, K measures the greatest \"contraction\" between nodes when they are mapped into the Euclidean space. In the same way, L measures the greatest \"stretch\" between nodes. We put quotes around \"contraction\" and \"stretch\" because it could be that K > 1 or L < 1. Then the ratio L/K measures, in some way, the worst case distortion when embedding the nodes in Euclidean space.

It\'s called the Advanced Cooking Machine, or ACM. The company that sells them is the ICPC. (You can come up with an acronym yourself.)\n\nEach ACM is rectangular in shape (when viewed from the top) with integer dimensions. No ACM is square-shaped.\n\nThe ACM is quite unique in its cooking method. When it starts, a magical beam of \"cooking laser\" is fired from the bottom-left corner at an angle of 45 degrees from the side. The laser beam passes through food completely and cooks them. However, when the beam hits one of the sides, it bounces in such a way that the angle remains 45 degrees. See the following image for an illustration:\n\n\n\nThe cooking ends when the beam hits any of the corners, in which case it is absorbed by the machine.\n\nIn addition, the four sides of an ACM are fitted with detectors, one for each side. These are used to keep track of the ACM\'s cooking performance. As the beam hits a side, the corresponding detector activates and then prints a single letter to the ACM\'s display. The top, left, bottom and right detectors output T, L, D and R respectively. Thus, when the cooking ends, a string of letters TLDR will be printed on the screen. For example, the ACM in the image above prints the string RLTRL.\n\nNaturally, this string will always be the same for a particular ACM; in other words it is only dependent on the dimensions R × C. Let\'s call this string the signature string of the ACM, and denote it as f(R, C).\n\nAnd since a longer signature string means more thorough cooking, the ICPC has decided to set the price of an ACM to be the length of the signature string, in dollars! In other words, the cost of the R × C ACM is |f(R, C)| dollars.\n\nChef, in keeping up with the times, has bought an ACM with dimensions R × C. Chef loved the ACM very much!

Each memory address is numbered from 1 to \\infty.\n\nKim knows that all of the data related to Jishnu\'s world domination plans is stored in N memory addresses. The ith memory address is A[i]. These memory addresses may be very large, so we can express an integer X as the product of K(X) prime factors raised to some power. The prime factors are given in increasing order. Formally, for an integer X, there are two K(X)-length arrays P(X) and Q(X) where P(X)[i] < P(X)[i+1] for all i, and X = \\prod_{i=1}^{K(X)} {P(X)[i]}^{Q(X)[i]}. This is the format that the input will be given in. Note that they may not be distinct.\n\nOf course, it takes time to move between memory addresses.

So, the total amount of time it takes for Kim to get all the information is \\sum_{i=1}^{N} dist(C,A[i]), where C was his starting memory address.

Hence Ciel wrote the combination in a text file and split the text file into K pieces, where each piece is compressed with some password. That is, she needs passwords for all K pieces for checking the combination of her safe.\n\n\n\nNow Ciel has forgotten the combination for her safe and passwords for all K pieces!\nHowever she remembers that the password for the i-th piece is a positive integer not greater than Ni, that is, there are only Ni possibilities for the i-th piece\'s password. So she\'d like to try brute-force.\n\n\n\nSince her computer is too slow,\nCiel decides to use computer centers in her town. There are C computer centers in all.\nSince Ciel is afraid of leaking the combination for her safe,\nCiel will use exactly K distinct computer centers, one center for one piece.\n\n\n\nCurrently Ciel is in her restaurant. Apparently her restaurant and all computer centers are located along one street. Hence we will consider Ciel\'s restaurant and computer centers as points on a coordinate line. Let\'s assume that Ciel\'s restaurant has coordinate 0 while the coordinate of the j-th computer center is Xj. So the distance between Ciel\'s restaurant and the j-th computer center is |Xj| meters while the sign of Xj indicates in which direction of the street (positive or negative) Ciel should walk to this center.\n\n\n\nAfter Ciel will choose K different centers for cracking passwords of her K pieces she will visit them in some order, crack all the pieces (one piece at one computer center) and return back to her restaurant. At each computer center she should wait until the password for the current piece will be cracked and only then she can proceed to the next center.\nCiel\'s walking speed is V meters per nanosecond, so she needs exactly |A − B| / V nanoseconds to walk from the point with coordinate A to the point with coordinate B.\n\n\n\nIn the j-th computer center, Ciel can use grid computing with at most Pj computers. Each computer is really faster than Ciel\'s one, it needs exactly Tj nanoseconds for checking one password. However computers are connected by really strange and bad network. So the step-by-step Ciel\'s plan for cracking the piece is the following:\n\nChoose some set of computers (among available Pj computers) that will be involved in the cracking process. This takes no time.\nCopy the compressed piece (which she decided to crack in this center) and the program that will be used for cracking directly into one of the chosen computers. This also takes no time.\nCopy the piece and the program to all of the remaining computers by one of the scenarios that she may choose. The copying process will be made by network connection between computers and may take some time. However, if she chooses only one computer than this step should be omitted.\nSimultaneously run the cracking program on all of the chosen computers.\nOnce one of the computers will crack the piece, save the password, terminate all the programs and delete all her information from all the computers. This takes no time since she will simply reboot and clear all the involved computers by the evil red button :)\nNow she can proceed to the next center or to the restaurant if this was the last piece.\n\n\n\n\nNow we describe in detail this plan.\n\n\n\nThe cracking program description. \nThe program that will be used for cracking proceeds as follows. At each step it chooses uniformly at random one of the valid passwords that was not chosen before and check this password (this takes exactly Tj nanoseconds). If the password is correct the program returns this password to the Ciel and terminates. Note that the computers can\'t connect to each other while this program is running at each of them. So it is possible that some passwords will be checked for several times at different computers.\n\n\n\nThe network connection. As was mentioned, the computers will distribute the piece and the program through the network connection between them. Bluntly speaking each time each computer that has the piece and the program try to connect to some other computer that has not yet this information and copy it to this computer. This process finishes when all required by Ciel computers have the piece and the program. Since the network connection is weird the time needed for connecting some computer to another computer is random! Namely it has the exponential distribution with mean Sj (see wikipedia for details). So the average time for connection between two computers is Sj nanoseconds.\nBut once connection between two computers is established some files or some data can be copied with no time. Note that computer can try to connect only to one other computer at the same time. However several computers can try to connect to the same computer and once one of them is connected all other computers will be immediately notified about this and stop the connection process with this computer.\n\n\n\nThe connection scenario details. Ciel can control how the computers will try to connect to each other. Namely, for each computer she can provide a preferences list, that is, the order in which this particular computer will try to connect to other computers after it receives the piece and the program. Initially the computer that receives the piece and the program from Ciel will start the process. Consider some computer A that has already received the piece and the program. It considers computers in its list one by one. If the current computer B in its list has already the piece and the program then it will skipped. This check requires no time since it can be made by instant ping from A to B. Otherwise the computer A will try to connect to the computer B and once connected copy required information to it. After that the computer A will proceed to the next computer in its list. It is possible that some other computers are trying to connect to the computer B at the same time when A doing this. In this case the first computer that establishes the connection will copy the piece and the program to B while other computers stop the connection process with B and proceed to the next computers in their lists. Only when all required computers will have the piece and the program Ciel simultaneously execute the program in all of them. Some examples for cracking are in NOTE 2.\n\n\n\nSo Ciel should choose the using computer center for each piece, choose the number of using computers and connection scenario in each computer center in order to minimize the expected needed total time to crack all the pieces and return back to her restaurant.\n\n\n\nNOTE 1.\nIf you\'ve never seen Box and Ball System, you may find it in BBSYSTEM. But it is not needed to understand Box and Ball System for solving this problem.\n\n\n\nNOTE 2.\nConsider the process of cracking the password with Ni = 3 by using 4 computers labeled by integers from 1 to 4. Let the correct password be 1, and wrong passwords be 2 and 3. Also since all computers are the same we may assume that Ciel will copy the piece and the program to the first computer and always choose the first several computers. \nSome of Ciel\'s choices are the following:\n\n\n\n1) Ciel uses only 1 computer.\nIn this case the time for connections is not needed.\nThe running time is Tj nanoseconds if the computer checks 1 at first (probability 1/3).\nThe running time is 2  Tj nanoseconds if the computer checks passwords in order (2, 1) or (3, 1) (probability 1/3).\nThe running time is 3  Tj nanoseconds if the computer checks passwords in order (2, 3, 1) or (3, 2, 1) (probability 1/3).\nThe expected needed time is Tj  (1/3) + 2  Tj  (1/3) + 3  Tj  (1/3) = 2  Tj nanoseconds.\n\n\n\n2) Ciel uses 2 computers. Then there is only one scenario of how the piece and the program will be distributed among the computers: computer 1 will send the program and the piece to the computer 2.\nThe expected time for this is Sj nanoseconds. The expected running time of the cracking program is more complicated to calculate. For example, the running time will be Tj nanoseconds if the pair of the first checked passwords by the computers is one of (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1), where the first elements is checked by the computer 1, and second is checked the computer 2. The running time may be 2  Tj or 3  Tj nanoseconds in many cases.\n\n\n\n3) Ciel uses 3 computers. In this case several preferences lists choices are available. For example, one of such choices can be represented as {(2, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1)}. Here (2, 3) is the preference list of computer 1, (1, 3) is the preference list of computer 2 and (2, 1) is the preference list of computer 3. For this scenario at first computer 1 will send the piece and the program to computer 2. And then both computers 1 and 2 will try to connect to computer 3.\nIf, for example, computer 2 will be connected to computer 3 at first then it copy the required information while the computer 1\'s trial will be canceled immediately. Then 3 computers may run the brute-force program. Here the expected time is secret. Please calculate by yourself.\n\n\n\n4) Ciel uses 4 computers.

This is challenge problem with the longest problem statement ever (it is even longer than for the legendary problem CIELHACK). You should invest some time in order to get all necessary points. But in the end there is a hint on how to get Accepted. So you will be awarded for your patience :)\n\n\n\nLet\'s play WordNinjas! (Note! CodeChef is not affiliated with iTunes/Apple in any ways :))\n\n\n\nIn short, you should create words from letters that your ninja will get by attacking tiles. Some special tiles contain bonuses.\n\n\n\nHere we consider some simplified version of the game where all the tiles are arranged in a line and we know their values in advance. Tiles are divided into blocks. At each move you can either skip the current block or take exactly one tile from it. Thus, you have a sequence of tile blocks as an input. Each block will be a string of characters where each character represents one tile. Each tile can be either a letter tile or some bonus tile. On each letter tile there will be written some letter of English alphabet and such tiles will be represented by the corresponding uppercase letters of English alphabet in the input. There exist 5 types of bonus tiles. The first one is a blank tile that behaves like an ordinary letter tile but you can write any letter on this tile when you create words (see below). The detailed description of all types of bonus tiles will be provided later.\n\n\n\nThe main aim of the game is to score as many points as possible. Most of the points can be gained by creating words. For this you have an array of length 7 that can be filled by letter or blank tiles that you get from the tile blocks. Each cell of the array can be occupied by at most one tile. If at some move you take some letter or blank tile but all 7 cells in the array are occupied, this tile will be thrown away, otherwise this tile will occupy the first unoccupied cell of the array. Thus, tiles in array always occupy several first cells. We number the cells in the array by numbers from 1 to 7. So if you have 5 tiles in the array they will occupy cells 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. You can also throw away tiles from the array at any time if you need this. Remaining tiles will be moved preserving their relative order and still will occupy several first positions. For example, if you have 5 tiles in the array and you throw away tiles from the 2nd and the 4th cells then the tile from the 3rd cell will occupy the 2nd cell and the tile from the 5th cell will occupy the 3rd cell after this operation.\n\n\n\nFinally, you can arbitrarily rearrange tiles in the array. Once you write some letters on all your blank tiles and get the rearrangement of tiles such that the corresponding sequence of letters forms a correct word you can play this word to get some points that depends on letters you have in this word and some other factors (see below). After this all the tiles except the last one will be thrown away from the array and the last tile will occupy the first position of the array. If it was the blank tile you can erase the letter you have written on it before and write another letter. Of course, you will be given a dictionary of all correct words that you can play. Note, that in all official input files this dictionary will be the same (see Test Case Generation section for details). But in the example we will use some dummy dictionary that consists of only two words :)\n\n\n\nTypes of bonus tiles:\n\nBlank tile. As mentioned before, it occupies one cell in the array and any letter can be written on it. You will get 5 points by taking a blank tile since the magic panda keeps this tile. It will be denoted by the character ? (question mark) in the input. You can carry several blank tiles in the array at the same time. When points for the played word are calculated it scores 0 points regardless of the letter that was written on it.\nDouble letter tile. It doubles points scored by the letter in the particular cell of the array. The tile that corresponds to the i-th cell will be represented by the digit i in the input.\nTriple letter tile. It triples points scored by the letter in the particular cell of the array. Since there are no uppercase digits in the English alphabet we will represent the triple letter tiles by lowercase English letters. That is, the character a in the input means the tile that triples score of the letter written on the tile that occupies the first cell of the array, character b do the same for the second cell and so on. Note that the letter tiles are represented by uppercase letters so there will be no ambiguities.\nDouble word tile. It doubles points scored by all letters in the array. This tile will be represented by + character.\nTriple word tile. It triples points scored by all letters in the array. This tile will be represented by  character.\n\n\n\n\nYou will get 2 points by taking tiles of the last four types since each such tile is kept by baby dragon. To describe in detail how these tiles behave let us introduce a concept of multipliers. Namely, each array cell (there are 7 of them) has its multiplier. Initially all these multipliers are equal to 1. A double letter tile assigns the multiplier for the corresponding cell to 2 and a triple letter tile assigns this multiplier to 3. So if multiplier for some position was 3 and you take the double letter tile for this cell it will be assigned to 2 and you will possibly get lower score for the word. The whole array also has a multiplier that initially equals to 1 and changes by double and triple word tiles in the same way as multipliers for particular cells. After you play a word all multipliers are reset to 1.\n\n\n\nHow many points will you get for a particular word? Each letter has some point value which is based on the letter\'s frequency in standard English writing: commonly used letters such as A or S are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The full distribution of points by letters coincides with the standard Scrabble\'s one and can be found here. For the sake of completeness we provide it here:\n\n\n\n 1 point: A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T, U\n 2 points: D, G\n 3 points: B, C, M, P\n 4 points: F, H, V, W, Y\n 5 points: K\n 8 points: J, X\n 10 points: Q, Z\n\n\n\n\nNow assume that you play a word of length L, where 2 ≤ L ≤ 7 (there are no words of length 1 in SOWPODS). Denote by C[i] the score of the i-th letter in this word according to the distribution above. As mentioned above, if some letter is created from the blank tile then the corresponding score is 0. Further denote by M[i] the multiplier of the i-th cell of the array and by M the multiplier of the whole array. Then the number of points you will get for this word equals to\n\n\n\nM  (M[1]  C[1] + ... + M[L]  C[L]) + 3  max(L − 3, 0) + 30  max(L − 6, 0).\n\n\n\nThe second summand means bonus points for long words and equals to 3 for 4-letter words, 6 for 5-letter words, 9 for 6-letter words and 12 for 7 letter-words. The last summand is additional large bonus of 30 points for 7-letter words. (In the actual WordNinjas game the whole score of the word is 10 times higher as well as the points for taking bonus tiles, but we get rid of this 10 in this problem.)\n\n\n\nThus, the total score you will get during the game is the sum of two sums, the first one is the sum of scores of all the played words during the game and the second one is the sum of points you got by taking bonus tiles.\n\n\n\nYour goal is to maximize your score. But this is a challenge problem and you don\'t need to find the optimal solution.\n\n\n'),(33530,'TABRARRAY','You are given a positive integer K and a tree with N vertices, rooted at vertex 1.\n\nFor all integer i (2 <= i <= N), P_i is a parent of vertex i.\n\nLet\'s call an array A consisting of N positive integers brilliant if the following constraints are met\n- A_{P_i}\\bmod A_i = 0, for all integer i (2 <= i <= N).\n- \\prod_{i=1}^N A_i <= K.\n\nCompute remainder modulo 998244353 of the number of possible brilliant arrays.'),(37824,'SPLITXORNOTX','For an array A and a number X, let\'s define f(A, X) as follows:\n\n- If it is not possible to split A into several consecutive subarrays in such a way, that the [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of all elements in each subarray is not equal to X, f(A, X) = 0.\n- Otherwise, f(A, X) is equal to the largest possible number of subarrays in such a split.\n\nYou are given integers N, K, and X, where 0 <= X \\lt 2^K.

Chef discovered that if he simultaneously sends password guesses to all servers, he can measure the response time to determine how accurately the guesses were.  Some of the servers in the network are \"honeypot\" servers that accept password guesses but cannot be accessed.  Chef does not know which servers are honeypots, but he knows how many there are.\nEach server has a password consisting of between 8 and 12 lowercase alphabetic characters.  There is also a \"salt\" string which is 8 characters long.  When a password guess comes to a server, the password guess is appended with the salt string, and then hashed with the SHA1 hashing algorithm.  (Most of the details of the SHA1 hashing algorithm are not relevant to this problem, other than the fact that it has an output size of 160 bits, each of which equally likely to be 0 or 1.)  The result is compared to the SHA1 hash of the actual password appended with the salt string. Chef is able to calculate the sum of the squares of the number of matching bits on each non-honeypot server (after all, the honeypot servers don\'t give any feedback).  This sum is denoted the \"score\" of a guess.\nThere is a limit on the number of password guesses Chef can make.

It can be done using fflush(stdout) command or by setting the proper type of buffering at the beginning of the execution - setlinebuf(stdout). Failure to flush the output buffer will result in Time Limit Exceeded verdict.\nScoring\nYour score will be the highest score across all password guesses, divided by N-H.\nThe goal is to maximise this score.\nSample Input + Output\n\nIn:  4 3 1\nOut: applepie\nOut: berrypie\nOut: cherrypie\nIn:  12186\nOut: bananapie\nOut: custardpie\nOut: lemonpie\nIn:  13466\nOut: keylimepie\nOut: pecanpie\nOut: blueberrypie\nIn:  7785\nOut: chocolatepie\nOut: custardpie\nOut: peachpie\nIn:  10517\n\n\n\nExplanation\nThe salt is \"codechef\".  The first server\'s password is \"challenge\".  The second server is the honeypot, and the third server\'s password is \"maythirteen\".  On the first guess, the hash of \"applepiecodechef\" is compared to the hash of \"challengecodechef\" and the hash of \"cherrypiecodechef\" is compared to the hash of \"maythirteencodechef\".  The hash of \"applepiecodechef\" is \"EC70A4442061F08180BDD0E1A4BD8284C5C72978\", and the hash of \"challengecodechef\" is \"4DE646F7F99F2735957070C9D49F1DA6960A8DD1\".  The hashes share 81 bits.  On the third server, the hashes share 75 bits.

If multiple chunks are assigned to the same server, there will not be enough space to store all of the chunks individually, so instead the chunks are combined together. When multiple chunks are combined together it is no longer possible to retrieve the data from the original chunks.

The forklift occupies one cell in the warehouse (initially, the northwest corner cell), and each shipment also occupies one cell in the warehouse. The forklift can carry up to one shipment at a time, and while carrying a shipment, the forklift and that shipment occupy the same cell.

Initially it consists of a single cell, but it can grow. A Snake can be described by the sequence of distinct cells it occupies in the field, (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2) ... (XK, YK) . The first cell of this sequence is called the head and the last cell is called its tail. Initially, the snake consists of a single cell (0, 0), and this cell is the head as well as the tail at the same time.\n\n\nThe snake can make a move in four directions. The head cell (X1, Y1) can be moved to one of the cells ((X1-1+N)%N, Y1), ((X1+1)%N, Y1),\n(X1, (Y1-1+M)%M) or (X1, (Y1+1)%M), i.e. to one of the four neighbours. Let the coordinate of the new cell to which snake\'s head moves be (Xnew, Ynew). Then, there are two cases:\n\n\n1) The new cell (Xnew, Ynew) contains an apple. In this case, the snake eats the apple, and the sequence describing the new state of snake becomes (Xnew, Ynew), (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2) ... (XK, YK) . That is, the new cell is appended to the beginning of the sequence by shifting all previous elements to the right. Obviously, the length of the snake will be increased by one after this move. Then, the apple is removed from this cell, and a new apple appears somewhere else.\n\n2) Otherwise, first, the length of snake is shortened by 1 by removing the tail. Then the new cell is appended to the beginning of the sequence, just like in previous case. In this case, the sequence describing the new state of snake becomes (Xnew, Ynew), (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2) ... (XK-1, YK-1) . The only difference from the previous case is that the tail cell will disappear, so the number of cells will not change. Note that (Xnew, Ynew) can be same as (XK, YK) in this case without causing any conflict. (XK-1, YK-1) will become the new tail cell [unless K=1 in which case (Xnew, Ynew) will be the head as well as the tail].\n\nNM-1 apples will appear in the field. You are given the sequence of NM-1 cells (not necessarily distinct). Initially, there will be an apple in the first cell from the sequence. When the snake eats it, a new apple appears in the second cell from the sequence, and so on. Your goal here is to make the snake eat all the NM-1 apples in minimal number of moves.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the first apple will not appear in the cell (0, 0). It is also guaranteed that any two consecutive cells from the sequence will not be the same. You can also assume that NM is even.\n\nNote\n\nYou should move your snake in such a way that at all times, the sequence describing the snake has distinct elements.\nThe game is different from conventional video game because the new apple can arrive on a cell already occupied by the snake.

Therefore, he is asking you for help with this problem.\n\nThis is an interactive problem.\n\nThere are N rectangles (numbered 1 through N) in a plane described by Cartesian coordinates x and y. Initially (at time 0), each rectangle is moving parallel to one of the coordinate axes with fixed speed 1 unit per second. You are given the width, height and position of each rectangle, as well as the direction in which it is initially moving.\n\nYou must repeat the following process N times:\n- Read a string S given by the grader. This string is either \"REVERSE\" or \"ROTATE\" and describes the operation you should perform on one rectangle. These operations are applied in chronological order, i.e. the current operation is applied after all the previous operations have already been applied.\n- Choose one rectangle on which this operation should be applied. Let\'s denote the number of this rectangle by r.\n- Choose the second s (between 1 and N inclusive) during which this operation should be applied. If an operation is applied during the s-th second, it means that is applied strictly between time s-1 and time s. Since the operations must be performed in chronological order, you may only choose the s-th second if all previous operations have been applied during the 1-st through s-th second (inclusive).\n- If S is \"REVERSE\", then during the s-th second, the direction in which the r-th rectangle is currently moving is reversed — it is changed from North to South, from South to North, from West to East or from East to West.\n- If S is \"ROTATE\", then during the s-th second, the direction in which the r-th rectangle is currently moving is rotated by 90^\\circ. You must choose the new direction dir for this rectangle\'s velocity. From North to South, you may change the direction to East or West (but not to North or South), and vice versa.\n\nThe rectangles are moving in discrete steps — at the end of each second (after all the operations applied during this second are performed), each rectangle moves by 1 unit in its currently assigned direction. The rectangles do not move at time 0, but they move at time N.\n\nLet\'s assign numbers and coordinates to directions in the following way:\n- moving by 1 unit in direction 0 (North): the y-coordinate increases by 1\n- moving by 1 unit in direction 1 (East): the x-coordinate increases by 1\n- moving by 1 unit in direction 2 (South): the y-coordinate decreases by 1\n- moving by 1 unit in direction 3 (West): the x-coordinate decreases by 1\n\nAfter N seconds (immediately after the rectangles moved at time N), consider the sum of common areas of each unordered pair of different rectangles, i.e. A = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j=i+1}^N \\mathrm{area}(i, j) where \\mathrm{area}(x, y) denotes the common area, i.e. area of the intersection of rectangles x and y.\n\nCan we maximise A if we apply the operations optimally?

Then, you need to construct a path in this graph that contains at least one of the just placed tiles such that the string obtained by writing out the letters from the nodes on this path (and previously replacing blank tiles with arbitrary Latin letters) is included in the provided dictionary of existing English words. You can\'t play one word twice, though the same blank tile can represent different letters in different turns.\n\nMoreover, each node has its own multiplier value, denoting the value by which the score of the placed tile will be multiplied anytime this node participates in the creation of a word.\n\nThe score you get for the turn will be equal to the sum of the scores for every tile used in the construction of the word,  each multiplied by the multiplier value of the corresponding node. The number of points for each letter is based on the letter\'s frequency in standard English writing and will be listed below; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, goign up to 10 points each for Q and Z.\n\nYou need to get as many points as possible in total, in the end (by the last of your output moves).

The cyberorganism can use this opportunity to make itself less vulnerable to the virus (i.e. minimise the number of infected cells after the virus finishes spreading).\n\nThe cyberorganism can reorganise itself by changing the order of the rows, columns and layers of its cells.

His son, prince Sebi, designed the first CPU of Chefland.\n\nNobody wants to argue with the son of the king, so everybody agrees that he is a great hardware designer. However, he forgot a lot of important instructions, like assigning a constant to a register. Chefland is now looking for a programmer who can load some given triplets to registers quickly.\n\nArchitecture of Sebi\'s CPU:\n- There are four 64-bit registers based on the [X64 architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/x64-architecture). These registers are named `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx` and `rdx`.\n- Parts of each 64-bit register can be used as smaller registers. For `y` equal to `a`, `b`, `c` or `d`, we have the following registers:\n    - `eyx`: the lower (least significant) 32 bits of `ryx`\n    - `yx`: the lower 16 bits of `ryx`\n    - `yl`: the lower 8 bits of `ryx`\n    - `yh`: the upper 8 bits of `yx`\n- The CPU cannot access any memory storage other than these registers.\n- The CPU supports several instructions based on assembly languages. Each instruction takes one or two registers as operands. Immediate values as operands are not supported. If an instruction takes two operands, they do not have to be distinct.\n- If an instruction takes two operands, they must have registers with the same width (number of bits). When the operands of an instruction are registers with width b, the values stored in them are treated as unsigned b-bit integers.\n- An instruction on registers with width b computes a result ― an unsigned b-bit integer ― and stores it in the register given as the first operand. In case of overflow or underflow, the result is treated as computed modulo 2^b; all bits outside the first-operand register remain unchanged.\n- The available one-operand instructions and their results are:\n    - `dec reg`: `reg` minus 1\n    - `inc reg`: `reg` plus 1\n    - `not reg`: bitwise NOT of `reg`\n- The available two-operand instructions and their results are:\n    - `and reg1 reg2`: bitwise AND of `reg1` and `reg2`\n    - `or reg1 reg2`: bitwise OR of `reg1` and `reg2`\n    - `xor reg1 reg2`: bitwise XOR of `reg1` and `reg2`\n    - `shl reg1 reg2`: `reg1` shifted left by `reg2` bits (and inserts `reg2` 0-s as the least significant bits)\n    - `shr reg1 reg2`: `reg1` shifted right by `reg2` bits (and inserts `reg2` 0-s as the most significant bits)\n    - `add reg1 reg2`: `reg1` plus `reg2`\n    - `sub reg1 reg2`: `reg1` minus `reg2`\n    - `mul reg1 reg2`: `reg1` multiplied by `reg2`\n    - `div reg1 reg2`: `reg1` divided by `reg2` (integer division)\n    - `mod reg1 reg2`: `reg1` modulo `reg2` (remainder of `reg1` after division by `reg2`)\n    - `mov reg1 reg2`: `reg2` (the instruction copies the value of `reg2` to `reg1`)\n- The only operations where the result could overflow are `shl`, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `inc` and `dec`. In `sub` and `dec`, the result of i-j modulo 2^b for j \\gt i is 2^b + i - j. In all other instructions, modulo simply corresponds to discarding all except the least significant b bits.\n- It is not allowed to use the `div` or `mod` operation if `reg2` contains 0.\n\nInitially, all four registers contain 0-s. You are given N triplets of 64-bit integers (a_1, b_1, c_1), (a_2, b_2, c_2), \\ldots, (a_N, b_N, c_N) and you should write a program (a sequence of instructions) such that each triplet appears in the registers at some point during the execution of this program. The order in which they appear does not matter. Formally, for each valid i, there should be an instruction in your program such that immediately after this instruction is executed, one of the registers contains the value a_i, one contains b_i and one contains c_i (the fourth register may contain anything).\n\n'),(34355,'STRFLIP','This problem is similar to the problem `\"STRFLIP2\"`.

For each valid i, initially, the position of the i-th ant is (X_i,Y_i).\n\nAda wants to gather all ants at a single point. In order to do that, she wants to give instructions to the ants. In each instruction:\n- First, Ada chooses a simple convex polygon with M vertices (numbered 1 through M clockwise) such that there is at least one ant in each of its vertices and no three of its vertices are collinear. The polygon may have area 0, in which case it is a line segment with only two vertices.\n- Then, for each i from 1 to M-1 (inclusive) in this order:\n    - Let\'s denote the set of all ants currently standing at the i-th vertex by A_i.

Interactive problems differ from classic problems in that your solution will send and receive data from a special judge program instead of from static files. Pay special attention to the notice on output buffering described in the \"Input + Output\" section below.\nIn this problem you will play the most famous darts game: 501 with double out.\n\nThe dartboard is circular board, divided into 20 numbered sections, scoring from 1 to 20 points, by wires running from the small central circle to the outer circular wire. Circular wires within the outer wire subdivide each section into single, double and triple areas. You can find the full description of 501 double out game with rules of playing on dartboard here.\n The 501 double out game:\nEach leg your score start from 501 and your darts score will decrease this score. In each turn you will have three darts to throw. The leg finish if your score is 0 and your last dart is in the double. A new leg starts with the score 501 just after finishing the previous one and  the remaining darts of the finishing turn will not be considered used. If your current turn score is greater than your score, then you will lose remaining darts of this turn and the score will remain same. If one uses all his darts and neither the leg finishes nor the turn, then the current turn score will be added to the total score if it is a valid turn. It is highly recommended to use our offline tester given below to understand the gaming process more clearly.\n Examples:\n\nIf your score 501 before the turn and you double 20, triple 19 and bull\'s eye, then you earn in this turn 220+319+225=147 score, then your scores after this turn is 501-147=354.\n\nIf your score 100 before the turn and you throw triple 20 and after that double 20, than this leg finishes, and you use in this turn 2 darts.\n\nIf your score 20 before the turn and you throw simple 19, then your scores go back to 20 (because from 1 you cannot checkout with double), and you lose those darts what in your hand for this turn. This turn we will call invalid turn.\n \n\nThe center of the board is (0,0), the top of the board is (0,-1), the left side is (-1,0), etc. So the dartboard is a circle of radius 1. For every tests belongs an Gaussian distribution with zero expected value and a standard deviation between 0 and 1. This will responsible for the throw precision. Every player has some (between 2 to 5) preferred place where he like to throw, to this place the throws are more precise. If your throw target covered by multiple preferred area than the better deviation is selected. All these are hidden. More description in the example section.\n\n\nFirstly you can throw darts for practice. This phase is to detect how the current player play darts. After that you can use 99999 darts. Your score is the sum of the score of your valid turns. You can not aim your darts outside the 1.2 radius. ( If the dart flew outside this radius that is valid but your target can not be outside this circle.)  \n \nInput + Output\n The output begins with a line containing an integer the number N ≤ 100000 of darts you would like to throw in practice mode. After that you can throw N darts\nA B A,B can be double numbers this is your target position\nafter each throw  you will get the answer in one line  with format:\nC D M S  \n(C,D) is the real position where your darts flew. M is an integer between 1 and 3 representing the dart multiplier (1- simple, 2- double, 3- triple) and S is another integer number representing dart score (without a multiplier).\nNow the compete mode begins. Here will use 99999 darts. (This doesn\'t mean you will throw 99999 darts. You may lose some dart in invalid turns.) The communication is the same as the training mode.\n\n\nAttention: the program should clear the output buffer after printing each line. It can be done using fflush(stdout) command or by setting the proper type of buffering at the beginning of the execution - setlinebuf(stdout). Failure to flush the output buffer will result in Time Limit Exceeded verdict.\n\nTest Case Generation\n \nThe 20% of the test files the deviation V selected from [0.01,0.1], the 60% selected from [0.1,0.3], and the remaining 20% selected from [0.3,1] interval.\nAfter that generate a number P between 2 and 5 (inclusive) how many preferred position has the player. Each preferred position is a circular area with center (X,Y) and radius R. Then the test case generator will generate X, Y and R, where (X,Y) are two real numbers inside the 1 radius circle centered at (0,0) and R is between 0.05 and 0.3. A multiplier Z for each preferred place will be generated, Z will be between 0.25 and 0.75, this means here the deviation is less by this multiplier (ZV instead of V).\n\n\nWe have 30 official test files. You must correctly solve all test files to receive \"Correct Answer\". During the contest, your overall score is the sum of the scores on the first 6 test files.

So we ask two random numbers (K,L) from our normal distribution generator \n(which generate with 0 expected value and 1 standard deviation). The real target will be (0+K0.05,0.55+L0.05). E.g. K=0.11, L= -0.28 \nthen the dart will flew (0.0055,0.536).\n\nIf our target is (0,0.7) which is outside of both the preferred places then the deviation multiplier here will be V = 0.1. In that case, the real target will be (0+KV, 0.7+LV), where (K,L) are two random numbers generated from our normal distributor. \n\nOffline tester/Visualization \n\n\nDarts.jar\n\n\nHow to use it.\n\nFinal Darts.jar\n\n\nNote: we can not guarantee the offline tester produce the same score as the online judge.\n\n\n'),(29639,'WIREL','\n\nAda is in charge of upgrading Chefland\'s electrical network — she is implementing wireless electricity!\n\nFor simplicity, let\'s consider Chefland a two-dimensional world, where the cities are represented by points on a plane and electric wires (which are not necessarily connecting the cities) are represented by straight line segments.\n\nThere are N cities in Chefland (numbered 1 through N) and M wires (numbered 1 through M).

Also, for each valid i, the i-th wire is a line segment with endpoints (A_i, B_i) and (C_i, D_i) initially.\n\nIn order to transmit power, Ada built two plates (line segments): the positive plate, which has endpoints (-1, 0) and (0, -1), and the negative plate, which has endpoints (10^6+1, 10^6) and (10^6, 10^6 + 1).\n\nA wire is positive if it intersects the positive plate or intersects another wire about which we already know that it is positive. Similarly, a wire is negative if it intersects the negative plate or another negative wire. It is not allowed for any wire to be both positive and negative, because that creates a short-circuit.\n\nFor each valid i, let S_i be the minimum of distances of the i-th city from endpoints of positive wires, and let T_i be the minimum of its distances from endpoints of negative wires. Then, the cost of transmitting electricity to the i-th city is S_i^2 + T_i^2. Let P be the sum of these costs over all cities.\n\nYou are allowed to move the wires, but not to rotate them. For each valid i, the cost of moving the i-th segment by h_i units horizontally and v_i units vertically from its original position is h_i^2 + v_i^2.

The graph contains a directed edge from every vertex i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) to every other vertex j (j != i) .We will denote such an edge by (i, j) and we will say that i is its starting vertex and j is its destination vertex. Thus, there are N(N-1) directed edges overall. Each of the directed edges has a unique cost in the range 1, 2, ... N(N-1).\n\nChef wants to play a game on this graph and has chosen you as his opponent. The game consists of alternating moves and you make the first move. Your first move consists of choosing a directed edge from the graph. Let\'s assume that this edge is (v1, v2). Then Chef will choose an edge (v2, v3). After that, at his/her turn, each player (whether you or Chef) will choose a directed edge which has not been chosen before by any of the players and whose starting vertex is the destination vertex of the directed edge chosen in the previous move (by the opponent). Thus, at your second move, you will choose an edge (v3, v4), then Chef will choose an edge (v4, v5), and so on. The game will end when the player whose turn is next cannot make any move (meaning that the destination vertex of the last chosen edge has no unselected outgoing edges left). Note that depending on how the game is played, the final move may be made by either Chef or you. Also note that the sequence of selected edges denotes a walk in Chef\'s graph, which may visit the same vertex zero or more times, but cannot visit the same directed edge more than once.\n\nAt the end of the game your game score GSyou and Chef\'s game score GSChef will be computed. GSyou is defined as the sum of the costs of all the edges you selected during the game and GSChef is analogously defined as the sum of the costs of all the edges Chef selected during the game. Your final score FS for the game is defined as the difference GSyou - GSChef (note that FS could be zero or negative as well).\n\nChef implemented his strategy in the interactive judge for this problem. However, this problem seems very complex to Chef, so he could only implement one of the two basic strategies described below:\nStrategy MAX: Let\'s assume that the last edge you selected is (a, b) and it is now Chef\'s turn to move. Chef will select the non-selected edge (b, c) having maximum cost among all the possible edges he can select (if any).\nStrategy RANDOM: Let\'s assume that the last edge you selected is (a, b) and it is now Chef\'s turn to move. Among all the non-selected edges (b, c), Chef will select one uniformly at random.\n\n\n\nYour task is to write a program which plays the game against Chef (i.e. against the interactive judge).

Secondly, every point must have distinct coordinates.\nAfter the points are positioned on the Cartesian plane, they need to be connected through line segments. The length of a line segment connecting two points is of course the euclidean distance between the points. There will be N − 1 line segments in total.

Two points are considered to be adjacent if they are connected through a line segment. You want to minimize the ratio between the maximum distance between any two adjacent points and the minimum distance between any two non-adjacent points over all the points on the Cartesian plane. Also there are some evil coordinates on the Cartesian plane. You will be given three integers A, B and S. Then, the coordinates (x, y) are evil coordinates if and only if (Ax mod 10007) + (By mod 10007) ≤ S. Assignment of evil coordinates to any point shall be avoided so far as possible.

Please refer to \"Interactivity details\" section in order to get acquainted with the IO format. Good luck!\n\nAbout two years ago, Sergey has bought a wallet. Since then, he\'s constantly facing kind of difficulty, when he pays for something.\n\nThe main reason is that the wallet doesn\'t have much sections in it, but Sergey, trying to be neat, always wants to keep his money in the sorted order. For example, he doesn\'t want to put the 50,000 burles bank note between two 100,000 burles bank notes. So, any time he gets the change, he finds the appropriate place in the wallet for each bank note, that might be very slow and irritating for both the cashier and for the next person in the queue, and our protagonist does not like it. Now it is time to change something!\n\nOf course, he could just order a credit card or more spacious wallet, but as the person who loves adventures, Sergey has decided to go another way.\n\nNow, in Sergey\'s country, there are N types of bank notes. The smallest bank note\'s value is 1 burle. The value of the bank note of the i-th type is Vi burles. Initially, Sergey has Ai bank notes of the value of Vi.\n\nOur protagonist plans all the purchases very well. For every his visit to the shop, he\'ll know the amount of money he\'s going to spend and will report it to you, right before the visit to this shop. The purchase proceeds in the following way: \n\nFirst, Sergey gives some amount of money to the cashier. This amount should not be less than the value of the purchase (obviously). Of course, Sergey is free to choose the way he\'ll collect the amount he\'s going to give, for example he can give 100,000 burles as one bank note of 100,000 burles, or he can use 1,000 bank notes of the value of 100 burles, or he can use 500 bank notes of the value of 100 burles and one bank note of the valie of 50,000 burles, etc. It will always be possible to give the amount, not less that the required.\nThen the cashier gives the change according to the following algorithm: first she gives as much bank notes of the largest value as possible in such a way that the given amount doesn\'t exceed the value of change, then she gives as much bank notes of the second largest value as possible in such a way that the given amount (considering previously given bank notes of the largest value, as well) doesn\'t exceed the amount of the change, and so on. Cashiers are provided with infinite number of bank notes of each type, and Sergey knows it well. In other words, cashiers collect the change greedily. Since there is a bank note of the value of 1, this algorithm will always be enough to collect the change correctly.\n\n\nThen, as the time goes, Sergey receives some more money. It can be a scholarship (he\'s a student), or anything else. Sergey knows the amount of money he\'s going to get any of these times. For getting it, there are a few ATMs in the city. The ATMs are not as good as cashiers, so each of them has infinite supply of some set of bank notes, but, possibly, not all the kinds. So each time, Sergey receives some money, he chooses the ATM where he wants to get it, and gets the whole amount from the specified ATM. Nevertheless, all the ATMs has supply of the bank note of the value of 1, so it\'s possible to receive the required amount of money from any of them. It needs to be pointed out that when Sergey receives some money, he collects it from the chosen ATM immediately. The ATMs work the same way as the cashiers when collect a change.\n\nSometimes, new bank notes are issued by Sergey\'s country National Bank. Sergey will provide you the information about such events as well. You can consider that after the new bank note is introduced, all the shops has infinite supply of this bank note immediately.\n\nFinally, some new ATMs might also be built. For each of them, the list of present bank notes will be given. Sergey explored the bank\'s website and gathered all the information about the new ATMs.\n\nNow, Sergey asks you to develop the strategy of how much money he needs to give, and using which bank notes; and which ATMs to use in order to minimize the total amount of bank notes that will be given to him as a change.\n\nTest data information\nThere are 20 test cases in total. The test cases are separated in 5 groups:\n\nGroup 1: 1 ≤ E ≤ 100, 1 ≤ Vi ≤ 1000.

When you create a new snake, then both head and tail of the snake will be same. \n\nIn your subsequent moves, you can increase length of your snake by extending it from either of its ends, i.e. from head or tail. In other words, you can choose an empty cell adjacent to either head or tail, and extend the snake by moving its respective end to the empty cell. A cell is said to be adjacent to other if they share a side (i.e. each cell has no more than 4 cells adjacent to it).\n\n\nIf at some stage, you are not able to extend the snake, then the snake will be considered dead.

In particular, it provides you coins of value 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000 euros. \n\n\n\nToday, Chef went to market with a coin of C euros, i.e. the coin with value C is among one of the above given 15 coins. Chef wanted to buy a brand new laptop worth L euros from a shop. Sadly the shop owner had just opened the shop and did not had any change. So he wanted the exact amount of money, no less, no more. Chef was forced to visit the nearby bank to obtain the desired change.\n\n\n\nIn the bank, Chef can ask for a change of some part of the amount C, and deposit the remaining money in his account. Bank will give him change in the coins of above given denominations.\n\n\n\nChef does not want to deposit a lot of amount in his account, as he believes in having as much cash in hand as possible. So, he wants to ask the bank for a change of as large amount as possible, such that it is possible to pay the L euros for the laptop. As Chef does not know what particular types of coins the bank will provide him in the change, he wants to make sure that with any type of coins bank might provide, he should be able to pay the laptop cost. \n  \n\n\nFor example, let Chef has initially 5 euros. The laptop cost is 1 euro. \n\nIf he asks bank to directly provide change for 5 euros, bank might provide him a coin of 5 euros, which he can\'t use to pay 1 euro.\nIf he asks bank to provide change for 4 euros, with bank depositing remaining 1 euro in his account, bank might provide him 2 coins of 2 euros each, which still he can\'t use to pay 1 euro.\nIf he asks bank to provide change for 3 euros, with bank depositing remaining 2 euros in his account, bank can give him either one coin of 1 euro and another coin of 2 euros, or three coins of 1 euro each. In both of these scenarios, Chef can use the 1 euro coin to pay for the laptop.\n\n\n\nSo, Chef will need to ask for a change of maximum 3 euros to ensure that he is able to pay for the laptop.\n\n\n\nYou can notice that Chef can directly ask the Bank to give him a change of L euros. But, in this way, bank will deposit C - L euros in his account. There might be a way of paying the laptop while getting a change of larger amount from the bank, thus depositing less amount in his bank balance. \n\n\n'),(7317,'CIELBALL','\nTomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much.\n\n\n\nSince Tomya has completed collecting the stamps in Ciel\'s restaurant, she now challenges the bonus game in her restaurant.\nThere are colored balls in a box.\nThe number of colors is N, and the number of balls color i in the box is Si for i = 1, 2, ..., N initially.\nAt first, Tomya has M coins.\nAnd Tomya\'s aim in this game is to get many coins at the end of the game.\nThis game will run as follows.\n\n\nTomya chooses a color, and Tomya bets some coins (suppose x coins are bet) on the color.\nHere x must be non-negative integer at most L, and Tomya must have x coins before betting.\nThen Ciel chooses a ball from the box, checks its color and discards the ball.\nIf the ball has the same color as Tomya\'s bet, then Tomya gets B·x coins, otherwise Tomya must pay x coins. Note that, if Tomya wins, then she receives back her bet as well as B·x coins.\nWhile the box has at least one ball, the above process are repeated.\nWhen the box is empty, the game is over.\n\n\nThe game is very kind, because Tomya always can increase her coins.\nInstead of this, Ciel is not kind in this game, she chooses the balls which minimize Tomya\'s coins at the end of the game (Yes, she can choose balls as she likes!).\nYour task is to calculate the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by Tomya at the end of the game.\n\n\n\n'),(26047,'SAFETR','\n\nThe kingdom of Treeland consists of N cities (numbered 1 through N) connected by N-1 bidirectional roads in such a way that there is a path between each pair of cities.\n\nIn order to increase security in Treeland, the government decided to set up police offices in K of its cities. For each valid i, the i-th office is in city V_i and it has a radius of efficiency R_i.\n\nLet\'s define the security level S_i of each city i as follows:\n- Initially, the security level of each city is equal to zero.\n- Then, for each police office j that was built (1 <= j <= K), the security levels change in the following manner:\n    - The security level of the city V_j increases by R_j.\n    - The security levels of all cities at the distance 1 from V_j increase by R_j-1.\n    - ...\n    - The security levels of all cities at the distance R_j-1 from V_j increase by 1.\n- Formally, for each city i, the j-th office increases the security level of this city by \\mathrm{max}(0, R_j - \\mathrm{distance}(i, V_j)).\n\nAlice was in charge of calculating the new security levels of all cities after the offices were built. She already finished her job and noticed an interesting coincidence: for each valid i, S_{V_i} = R_i holds. Now she has challenged you to find the security levels of all cities.\n\n'),(14593,'UNGAME',' \n\n\nRecently Chef invented a two player game. The game is played on a horizontal strip consisting of n cells that are numbered from left to right with consecutive integers from 1 to n. At the beginning of the game, a pawn is placed at the cell numbered x. The players make moves alternately, i.e. the first player makes all odd numbered moves (1st, 3rd, 5th and so on) and the second player all even numbered moves (2nd, 4th, 6th and so on). During the k-th move the player should move the pawn either exactly k cells to the left or exactly k cells to the right (provided the pawn doesn\'t land outside the strip). For example, in the k-th move, if the pawn is located at cell p before the move, it can be moved to either (p - k) or (p + k) if the appropriate cells are part of the strip	. The player who is not able to make a move (i.e. both the above choices lead to cells outside of the strip) loses the game. Assume that both the players play optimally.\n\nBefore trying to play the game himself, Chef wants to understand the game more. So, he wants to find the outcome of m such games, where in the i-th game the initial location of pawn is xi. Can you please help Chef in this?\n\n'),(33345,'PSLISCNT','\n\nLet\'s denote the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence of the array B by \\mathbf{LIS}(B). \n\nFor a permutation A of integers from 1 to N we can define two arrays of integers P and S, both of length N: P_i = \\mathbf{LIS}(A[1:i]) = \\mathbf{LIS}([A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_i]), S_i = \\mathbf{LIS}(A[i:N]) = \\mathbf{LIS}([A_i, A_{i+1}, \\ldots, A_N]).\n\nLet\'s call a pair of arrays (P, S)  \\mathit{viable}, if there exists a permutation A with these arrays as P and S.\n\nGiven array P of length N, calculate the number of arrays S such that (P, S) is viable, modulo 998\\,244\\,353.'),(33374,'PERMLISCNSTR','\n\nLet\'s denote the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence of the array B by \\mathbf{LIS}(B). \n\nFor a permutation A of integers from 1 to N we can define two arrays of integers P and S, both of length N: P_i = \\mathbf{LIS}(A[1:i]) = \\mathbf{LIS}([A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_i]), S_i = \\mathbf{LIS}(A[i:N]) = \\mathbf{LIS}([A_i, A_{i+1}, \\ldots, A_N]).\n\nLet\'s call a pair of arrays (P, S) \\mathit{viable}, if there exists a permutation A with these arrays as P and S.\n\nGiven two arrays P and S of length N, check if the pair (P, S) is viable and if it is, find any permutation A with these arrays as P and S.'),(15193,'LOGMAT',' \n Charles: \"She can learn to be BETTER.\" \n Logan: \"Better than me??\" \n Charles: \"Actually, YES!!\"\n\n Charles wants Logan to train Laura, and Logan reluctantly agrees. \n As a part of the training, Logan and Laura visit a park which is in the form of a rectangular grid i.e like a Matrix  \n The rows are defined in top to bottom order, and the columns are defined in left to right order \n At each of the position represented as  , there exists an item of value  . \n Logan decided to train Laura by giving her  difficult tasks. \n Each of the  tasks can be defined as follows: \n Logan provides Laura coordinates of 2 rectangular sub-grids.  \n First of all, Laura must ignore the common area of both the rectangular sub-grids. \n Now, with the area remaining in both sub-grids, she has to find  \n She has to compute  \n Logan doesn\'t stop at this, as he wants Laura to be the best. \n He takes Laura to another park in the form of a square grid i.e like a matrix   \n If Laura is at some point  in the grid , then in a single step she can move to another point  if the following condition is satisfied: \n\n Now, he gives her  queries to answer.\n In each query, Logan provides her a coordinate  inside the grid   \n She has to move exactly  steps in the square grid.  \n The steps must be taken in such a way that at each instant she stays in the park only.  \n Laura needs to tell the distinct number of ways to achieve the required goal. \n Two ways are considered to be different if they have atleast one different step. \n As the number of ways can be very large, print the answer modulo 109+7\n Note: Large I/O Files.
