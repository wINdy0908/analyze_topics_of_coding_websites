If there is no such string, return an empty string.\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. For example, \"aabd\" is lexicographically smaller than \"aaca\" because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and \'b\' comes before \'c\'.\n\n'),(2574,'left-and-right-sum-differences','Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a 0-indexed integer array answer where:\n\nanswer.length == nums.length.\nanswer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|.\n\nWhere:\n\nleftSum[i] is the sum of elements to the left of the index i in the array nums. If there is no such element, leftSum[i] = 0.\nrightSum[i] is the sum of elements to the right of the index i in the array nums.
