    "Using MySQL, API scraping, Selenium, and the BERT model, we are able to handle data from three coding practice websites, including Interviewbit, Codechef, and Leetcode. With the BERT model, we analyze the topics of problems, which helps users identify the topics of problems they may be unfamiliar with, allowing them to strengthen their problem-solving skills in related areas. We also conduct simple analyses on the three websites to determine which problem topics appear more frequently in interviews. The purpose of this project is to assist programmers in identifying specific problem topics and determining the topics of unknown problems."

    "Software engineering has become a highly competitive field worldwide, and many people are interested in making a career change to a software engineering-related position. Therefore, it is essential to enhance coding skills. This motivation led us to explore the differences between three coding practice websites and use them as a basis to determine problem topics using the BERT model. Additionally, we created an integrated search function to enable users to access coding problems across all three websites. We firmly believe that this project will be of great value to programmers."
